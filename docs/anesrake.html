<td>Description:</td>
<td>Provides a comprehensive system for selecting
    variables and weighting data to match the specifications of the American
    National Election Studies. The package includes methods for identifying
    discrepant variables, raking data, and assessing the effects of the raking
    algorithm. It also allows automated re-raking if target variables fall
    outside identified bounds and allows greater user specification than other
    available raking algorithms. A variety of simple weighted statistics that
    were previously in this package (version .55 and earlier) have been moved to
    the package 'weights.'</td>

Function to perform full ANES variable selection and weighting.
</h2><span id='topic+anesrake'></span><span id='topic+print.anesrake'></span><span id='topic+summary.anesrake'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>anesrake</code> takes a list of variables and target values and determines how they should be weighted to match the procedures outlined in DeBell and Krosnick, 2009.  It then performs raking to develop weights for the variables selected such that they match the targets provided.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>anesrake(inputter, dataframe, caseid, weightvec = NULL,
cap = 5, verbose = FALSE, maxit = 1000, type = "pctlim",
pctlim = 5, nlim = 5, filter = 1, choosemethod = "total",
iterate = TRUE, convcrit = 0.01, force1=TRUE, center.baseweights=TRUE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr><td><code id="anesrake_+3A_inputter">inputter</code></td>
<td>

<p>The <code>inputter</code> object should contain a list of all target values for the raking procedure.  Each list element in <code>inputter</code>  should be a vector corresponding to the weighting targets for a single variable.  Hence, the vector enumerating the weighting targets for a variable with 2 levels should be of length 2, while a vector enumerating the weighting targets for a variable with 5 levels should be of length 5.  List elements in inputter should be named according to the variable that they will match in the corresponding dataset.  Hence, a list element enumerating the proportion of the sample that should be of each gender should be labeled &quot;female&quot; if the variable in <code>dataframe</code> is also titled &quot;female.&quot;
</p>
<p><code>inputter</code> elements must be vectors and can be of class numeric, or factor and must match the class of the corresponding variable in <code>dataframe</code>.  Logical variables in <code>dataframe</code> can be matched to a numeric vector of length 2 and ordered with the <code>TRUE</code> target as the first element and the <code>FALSE</code> target as the second element.  Targets for factors must be labeled to match every level present in the dataframe (e.g. a variable with 2 age groups &quot;under40&quot; and &quot;over40&quot; should have elements named &quot;under40&quot; and &quot;over40&quot; respectively).  <code>anesrake</code> attempts to conform any unrecognized types of vectors to <code>class(numeric)</code>. Weighting targets can be entered either as an N to be reached or as a percent for any given variable.  Targets can be either proportions (ideal) or the number of individuals in the population in each target category (N).  Totals of greater than 1.5 for any given list element are treated as Ns, while values of less than 1.5 are treated as percentages.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="anesrake_+3A_dataframe">dataframe</code></td>
<td>

<p>The <code>dataframe</code> command identifies a <code>data.frame</code> object of the data to be weighted.  The data.frame must contain all of the variables that will be used in the weighting process and those variables must have the same names as are present in the <code>inputter</code> list element.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="anesrake_+3A_caseid">caseid</code></td>
<td>

<p>The <code>caseid</code> command identifies a unique case identifier for each individual in the dataset.  If filters are to be used, the resulting list of weights will be a different length from the overall <code>dataframe</code>.  <code>caseid</code> is included in the output so that weights can be matched to the dataset of relevance.  <code>caseid</code> must be of a length matching the number of cases in <code>dataframe</code>.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="anesrake_+3A_weightvec">weightvec</code></td>
<td>

<p><code>weightvec</code> is an optional input if some kind of base weights, stratification correction, or other sampling probability of note that should be accounted for before weighting is conducted.  If defined, <code>weightvec</code> must be of a length equivalent to the number of cases in the <code>dataframe</code>.  If undefined, <code>weightvec</code> will be automatically seeded with a vector of 1s.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="anesrake_+3A_cap">cap</code></td>
<td>

<p><code>cap</code> defines the maximum weight to be used.  <code>cap</code> can be defined by the user with the command <code>cap=x</code>, where <code>x</code> is any value above 1 at which the algorithm will cap weights.  If <code>cap</code> is set below 1, the function will return an error.  If <code>cap</code> is set between 1 and 1.5, the function will return a warning that the low cap may substantially increase the amount of time required for weighting.  In the absence of a user-defined cap, the algorithm defaults to a starting value of 5 in line with DeBell and Krosnick, 2009.  For no cap, <code>cap</code> simply needs to be set to an arbitrarily high number. (Note: Capping using the <code>cap</code> command caps at each iteration.)
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="anesrake_+3A_verbose">verbose</code></td>
<td>

<p>Users interested in seeing the progress of the algorithm can set <code>verbose</code> to equal <code>TRUE</code>.  The algorithm will then inform the user of the progress of each raking and capping iteration.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="anesrake_+3A_maxit">maxit</code></td>
<td>

<p>Users can set a maximum number of iterations for the function should it fail to converge using <code>maxit=X</code>, where <code>X</code> is the maximum number of iterations.  The default is set to 1000.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="anesrake_+3A_type">type</code></td>
<td>

<p><code>type</code> identifies which manner of variable identification should be used to select weighting variables.  Five options are available: <code>type=c("nolim", "pctlim", "nlim", "nmin", "nmax")</code>.  If <code>type="nolim"</code>, all variables specified in <code>inputter</code> will be included in the weighting procedure.  If <code>type="pctlim"</code> (DEFAULT), the variable selection algorithm will assess which variables have distributions that deviate from their targets by more than the amount specified by the <code>pctlim</code> command using the method <code>choosemethod</code>.  If <code>type="nlim"</code>, the variable selection algorithm will use the number of varibles specified by <code>nlim</code>, choosing the most discrepant variables as identified by the <code>choosemethod</code> command.  If <code>type="nmin"</code>, the variable selection algorithm will use at least <code>nlim</code> variables, but will include more if additional variables are off by more than <code>pctmin</code> (all identified using <code>choosemethod</code>).  If <code>type="nmax"</code>, the variable selection algorithm will use no more than <code>nlim</code> variables, but will only use that many variables if at least that many are off by more than <code>pctlim</code> (all identified using <code>choosemethod</code>).
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="anesrake_+3A_pctlim">pctlim</code></td>
<td>

<p><code>pctlim</code> is the discrepancy limit for selection.  Variable selection will only select variables that are discrepant by more than the amount specified. <code>pctlim</code> can be specified either in percentage points (5 is 5 percent) or as a decimal (.05 is 5 percent).  The algorithm assumes that a decimal is being used if <code>pctlim&lt;1</code>.  Hence researchers interested in a discrepancy limit of half a percent would need to use <code>pctlim=.005</code>.  
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="anesrake_+3A_nlim">nlim</code></td>
<td>

<p><code>nlim</code> is the number of variables to be chosen via the variable selection method chosen in <code>choosemethod</code>.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="anesrake_+3A_filter">filter</code></td>
<td>

<p><code>filter</code> is a vector of 1 for cases to be included in weighting and 0 for cases that should not be included.  The <code>filter</code> vector must have the same number of cases as the <code>dataframe</code>.  In the absence of a user-defined <code>filter</code>, the algorithm defaults to a starting value of 1 (inclusion) for all individuals.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="anesrake_+3A_choosemethod">choosemethod</code></td>
<td>

<p><code>choosemethod</code> is the method for choosing most discrepant variables.  Six options are available: <code>choosemethod=c("total", "max", "average", "totalsquared", "maxsquared", "averagesquared")</code>.
If <code>choosemethod="total"</code>, variable choice is determined by the sum of the differences between actual and target values for each prospective weighting variable.  If <code>choosemethod="max"</code>, variable choice is determined by the largest individual difference between actual and target values for each prospective weighting variable.  If <code>choosemethod="average"</code>, variable choice is determined by the mean of the differences between actual and target values for each prospective weighting variable.  If <code>choosemethod="totalsquared"</code>, variable choice is determined by the sum of the squared differences between actual and target values for each prospective weighting variable.  If  <code>choosemethod="maxsquared"</code>, variable choice is determined by the largest squared difference between actual and target values for each prospective weighting variable (note that this is identical to  <code>choosemethod="max"</code> if the selection type is <code>nlim</code>).  If  <code>choosemethod="averagesquared"</code>, variable choice is determined by the mean of the squared differences between actual and target values for each prospective weighting variable.  
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="anesrake_+3A_iterate">iterate</code></td>
<td>

<p><code>iterate</code> is a logical variable for how raking should proceed if  <code>type=c("pctlim", "nmin", "nmax")</code> conditions.  If <code>iterate=TRUE</code>, <code>anesrake</code> will check whether any variables that were not used in raking deviate from their targets by more than <code>pctlim</code> percent.  When this is the case, raking will be rerun using the raked weights as seeds (<code>weightvec</code>) with additional varibles that meet this qualification after raking included as well.  For the <code>type="nmax"</code> condition, this will only occur if <code>nlim</code> has not been met.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="anesrake_+3A_convcrit">convcrit</code></td>
<td>

<p><code>convcrit</code> is the criterion for convergence.  The raking algorithm is determined to have converged when the most recent iteration represents less than a <code>convcrit</code> percentage improvement over the prior iteration.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="anesrake_+3A_force1">force1</code></td>
<td>

<p><code>force1</code> ensures that the categories of each raking variable sum to 1.  To do so, the target in inputter for each variable is divided by the sum of the targets for that category.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="anesrake_+3A_center.baseweights">center.baseweights</code></td>

<p><code>center.baseweights</code> forces the initial baseweight to mean to 1 if true (the default setting).

If filters are to be used, the resulting list of weights will be a different length from the overall <code>dataframe</code>.  <code>caseid</code> is included in the output so that weights can be matched to the dataset of relevance.  <code>caseid</code> must be of a length matching the number of cases in <code>dataframe</code>.

<p><code>weightvec</code> is an optional input if some kind of base weights, stratification correction, or other sampling probability of note that should be accounted for before weighting is conducted.  If defined, <code>weightvec</code> must be of a length equivalent to the number of cases in the <code>dataframe</code>.  If undefined, <code>weightvec</code> will be automatically seeded with a vector of 1s.

<p><code>cap</code> defines the maximum weight to be used.  <code>cap</code> can be defined by the user with the command <code>cap=x</code>, where <code>x</code> is any value above 1 at which the algorithm will cap weights.  If <code>cap</code> is set below 1, the function will return an error.  If <code>cap</code> is set between 1 and 1.5, the function will return a warning that the low cap may substantially increase the amount of time required for weighting.  In the absence of a user-defined cap, the algorithm defaults to a starting value of 5 in line with DeBell and Krosnick, 2009.  For no cap, <code>cap</code> simply needs to be set to an arbitrarily high number. (Note: Capping using the <code>cap</code> command caps at each iteration.)

<p>Users interested in seeing the progress of the algorithm can set <code>verbose</code> to equal <code>TRUE</code>.  The algorithm will then inform the user of the progress of each raking and capping iteration.

<p>Users can set a maximum number of iterations for the function should it fail to converge using <code>maxit=X</code>, where <code>X</code> is the maximum number of iterations.  The default is set to 1000.

Assessment of Weighting
</h2><span id='topic+weightassess'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Shows weighted data on specified variables compared to targets and baseweights.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>weightassess(inputter, dataframe, weightvec, prevec = NULL)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr><td><code id="weightassess_+3A_inputter">inputter</code></td>
<td>

<p>The <code>inputter</code> object should contain a list of all target values for the raking procedure.  Each list element in <code>inputter</code>  should be a vector corresponding to the weighting targets for a single variable.  Hence, the vector enumerating the weighting targets for a variable with 2 levels should be of length 2, while a vector enumerating the weighting targets for a variable with 5 levels should be of length 5.  List elements in inputter should be named according to the variable that they will match in the corresponding dataset.  Hence, a list element enumerating the proportion of the sample that should be of each gender should be labeled &quot;female&quot; if the variable in <code>dataframe</code> is also titled &quot;female.&quot;
</p>
<p><code>inputter</code> elements must be vectors and can be of class numeric, or factor and must match the class of the corresponding variable in <code>dataframe</code>.  Logical variables in <code>dataframe</code> can be matched to a numeric vector of length 2 and ordered with the <code>TRUE</code> target as the first element and the <code>FALSE</code> target as the second element.  Targets for factors must be labeled to match every level present in the dataframe (e.g. a variable with 2 age groups &quot;under40&quot; and &quot;over40&quot; should have elements named &quot;under40&quot; and &quot;over40&quot; respectively).  <code>anesrake</code> attempts to conform any unrecognized types of vectors to <code>class(numeric)</code>. Weighting targets can be entered either as an N to be reached or as a percent for any given variable.  Targets can be either proportions (ideal) or the number of individuals in the population in each target category (N).  Totals of greater than 1.5 for any given list element are treated as Ns, while values of less than 1.5 are treated as percentages.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="weightassess_+3A_dataframe">dataframe</code></td>
<td>

<p>The <code>dataframe</code> command identifies a <code>data.frame</code> object of the data to be weighted.  The data.frame must contain all of the variables that will be used in the weighting process and those variables must have the same names as are present in the <code>inputter</code> list element.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="weightassess_+3A_weightvec">weightvec</code></td>
<td>

<p><code>weightvec</code> is a vector of final weights that are to be assessed.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="weightassess_+3A_prevec">prevec</code></td>
<td>

<p><code>prevec</code> is an optional input if some kind of base weights, stratification correction, or other sampling probability of note that should be accounted for before weighting is conducted.  If defined, <code>prevec</code> must be of a length equivalent to the number of cases in the <code>dataframe</code>.  If undefined, <code>prevec</code> will be automatically seeded with a vector of 1s.
</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Prints out a list of all levels of all variables named in inputter.  For each variable, shows values weighted with prevec, weightvec, and the targets and assesses discrepancies for each.
