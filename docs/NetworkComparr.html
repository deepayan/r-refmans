<h2 id='CompareEdgelistNetworks'>Statistical Comparison of Networks based on Edgelists</h2><span id='topic+CompareEdgelistNetworks'></span><span id='topic+CEN'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This permutation-based hypothesis test assesses the differences between two networks based on the invariance measures of the R package 'NetworkComparisonTest' by van Borkulo et al. (2022): global strength invariance, network structure invariance, edge invariance, and various centrality measures. The global strength invariance represents the differences in the total number of all edges. The network structure invariance involves only the edge that differs the most in its count. The edge invariance covers the differences of the specified individual edges. The centrality measures covers the differences regarding the importance of the individual nodes. Edgelists of two comparable group networks from dependent or independent samples are used as input. These edgelists can be generated from individual graphical network representations, such as concept maps. The networks can be directed or undirected.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>CEN(EL1, EL2, noc, it = 10000,
             paired = FALSE, directed = FALSE, abs = TRUE, plot = TRUE,
             test.edges = TRUE, edges = "all", progressbar = TRUE,
             p.adjust.methods = c("none", "holm", "hochberg","hommel",
                                   "bonferroni", "BH", "BY", "fdr"),
             test.centrality = TRUE, centrality = c("all"), cen.nodes = "all",
             test.bridge.centrality = FALSE, bridge.centrality = c("all"),
             brg.nodes= "all", communities = NULL, useCommunities = "all",
             verbose = TRUE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table role = "presentation">
<tr><td><code id="CompareEdgelistNetworks_+3A_el1">EL1</code></td>
<td>
<p>Edgelist 1. One of two edgelists containing the subject number and the coding of the network. The object type is &quot;data.frame&quot;, the columns must be labeled &quot;person&quot;, &quot;from&quot; and &quot;to&quot;. &quot;Person&quot; contains the subject number. For dependent samples, the same person must have the same label in both edgelists. For independent samples, the same subject number cannot occur twice in the two edgelists. &quot;From&quot; indicates where an edge begins, &quot;to&quot; indicates where it ends. For undirected networks, an edge can be specified in one direction only. The direction is irrelevant (e.g., from 1 to 2, or from 2 to 1). The nodes must be numbered and must not have labels of the class character. The example serves as an orientation for the structure of the data frame.</p>
