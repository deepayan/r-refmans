<td>Description:</td>
<td>The t-designs represent a generalized class of balanced incomplete block designs in which the number of blocks in which any t-tuple of treatments (t &gt;= 2) occur together is a constant. When the focus of an experiment lies in grading and selecting treatment subgroups, t-designs would be preferred over the conventional ones, as they have the additional advantage of t-tuple balance. t-designs can be advantageously used in identifying the best crop-livestock combination for a particular location in Integrated Farming Systems that will help in generating maximum profit. But as the number of components increases, the number of possible t-component combinations will also increase. Most often, combinations derived from specific components are only practically feasible, for example, in a specific locality, farmers may not be interested in keeping a pig or goat and hence combinations involving these may not be of any use in that locality. In such situations partially balanced t-designs with few selected combinations appearing in a constant number of blocks (while others not at all appearing) may be useful (Sayantani Karmakar, Cini Varghese, Seema Jaggi &amp; Mohd Harun (2021)&lt;<a href="https://doi.org/10.1080%2F03610918.2021.2008436">doi:10.1080/03610918.2021.2008436</a>&gt;). Further, every location may not have the resources to form equally sized homogeneous blocks. Partially balanced t-designs with unequal block sizes (Damaraju Raghavarao &amp; Bei Zhou (1998)&lt;<a href="https://doi.org/10.1080%2F03610929808832657">doi:10.1080/03610929808832657</a>&gt;. Sayantani Karmakar, Cini Varghese, Seema Jaggi &amp; Mohd Harun (2022)." Partially Balanced t-designs with unequal block sizes") prove to be more suitable for such situations.This package generates three series of partially balanced t-designs namely Series 1, Series 2 and Series 3. Series 1 and Series 2 are designs having equal block sizes and with treatment structures 4(t + 1) and a prime number, respectively. Series 3 consists of designs with unequal block sizes and with treatment structure n(n-1)/2. This package is based on the function named PBtD() for generating partially balanced t-designs along with their parameters, information matrices, average variance factors and canonical efficiency factors.</td>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This package contains functions named PBtD() for generating partially balanced t-designs along with their parameters, information matrices, average variance factors and canonical efficiency factors.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>PBtD(v, Series)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Three series are given for generating of partially balanced t-designs namely Series 1, Series 2 and Series 3.
</p>
<p>Series 1 are designs having equal block sizes and with treatment structure 4(t + 1).
</p>
<p>Series 2 are designs having equal block sizes and with treatment as a prime number.
</p>
<p>Series 3 consists of designs with unequal block sizes and with treatment structure n(n-1)/2.
</p>
<p>This function generates partially balanced t-designs along with their parameters, information matrices, average variance factors and canonical efficiency factors.
