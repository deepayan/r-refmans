<td>The King's Health Questionnaire (KHQ) is a disease-specific,

  It is a simple, acceptable and reliable measure to use in the clinical setting

  evaluation of health care. The subject self-rates their health in terms of 
  five dimensions: Role Limitation (RL), Physical Limitations (PL), Social 
  Limitations (SL), Emotions (E), and Sleep (S). Frequently the states on these 
  five dimensions are converted to a single utility index using country specific 
  value sets, which can be used in the clinical and economic evaluation of 
  health care as well as in population health surveys. This package provides 
  methods to calculate scores for each dimension of the KHQ; converts KHQ item 
  scores to KHQ5D scores; and also calculates the utility index of the KHQ5D.</td>
