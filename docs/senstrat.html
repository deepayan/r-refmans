<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Of limited interest to most users, the evall() function plays an internal role in 2-sample and stratified sensitivity analyses.  The expectation and variance returned by the evall() function are defined in the third paragraph of section 4, page 495, of Rosenbaum and Krieger (1990).  The function evall() calls the function ev() to determine the expectation and variance of the test statistic for an unobserved covariate u with length(z)-m 0's followed by m 1's, doing this for m=1,...,length(z)-1.

<p>Within each stratum, the observations are aligned or centered by subtracting a location measure computed from observations in that stratum.

If align=&quot;huber&quot;, then the Huber's m-estimate is subtracted, as computed by the function huber() in the MASS package.  If align=&quot;hl&quot;, then the one-sample Hodges-Lehmann estimate is subtracted, as suggested by Mehrotra et al. (2010), and as computed by the wilcox.test() function in the stats package.  The wilcox.test() command may generate numerous warnings about situations that are not hazardous, such as ties.  When align=&quot;hl&quot;, warnings produced by wilcox.test() are suppressed.

<p>For an unstratified two-sample comparison, st = NULL.  For a stratified comparison, st is a vector of stratum indicators with length(st)=length(y).  The vector st may be numeric, such as 1,2,..., or it may be a factor.

<p>The two parameters, inner&gt;=0 and trim&gt;inner, determine the odd <code class="reqn">\psi</code>-function of the M-statistic.  Huber favored an M-statistic similar to a trimmed mean, with inner=0, trim&gt;0, so that <code class="reqn">\psi(y)</code> is max(-trim,min(trim,y)).  Setting inner&gt;0 ignores y near zero and is most useful for matched pairs; see Rosenbaum (2013).  In general, <code class="reqn">\psi(y)</code> is sign(y)*trim*min(trim-inner,max(0,abs(y)-inner))/(trim-inner), so it is zero for y in the interval [-inner,inner], and rises linearly from 0 to trim on the interval y=inner to y=trim, and equals trim for y&gt;trim.  If trim=Inf, then no trimming is done, and <code class="reqn">\psi(y)</code> = y.

<p>The <code class="reqn">\psi</code>-function is applied to a treated-minus-control difference in responses after scaling by the lambda quantile of the within-strata absolute differences.  Typically, lambda=1/2 for the median.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="mscores_+3A_tau">tau</code></td>

<p>If tau=0, then the null hypothesis is Fisher's sharp null hypothesis of no treatment effect.  If tau is nonzero, then tau is subtracted from the y's for treated responses before scoring the y's.  If tau is nonzero, the null hypothesis is that the treatment has a constant additive effect tau, the same for all strata.
</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A vector of length(y) containing the M-scores.  The M-scores may be used in senstrat() or sen2Sample().
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>The ith response in stratum s, R[si], is compared to the jth response in stratum s, R[sj], as
<code class="reqn">\psi</code>((R[si]-R[sj])/<code class="reqn">\sigma</code>), and for each fixed i these values are averaged over the n[s]-1 choices of j in stratum s, where n[s] is the size of stratum s, thereby producing the M-score for R[si].  Here, <code class="reqn">\sigma</code> is the lambda quantile, usually the median, of |R[si]-R[sj]|, taken over all within stratum comparisons.  This extension to stratified comparisons of the method of Maritz (1979) for matched pairs is described in Rosenbaum (2007, 2017).

It would be common to report that rejection of the null hypothesis at conventional level=0.05 is insensitive to a bias of <code class="reqn">\Gamma</code> if this <code class="reqn">\Gamma</code> is the largest <code class="reqn">\Gamma</code> leading to rejection.

<h3>Note</h3>

<p>Strata that contain only treated subjects or only controls do not affect permutation inferences.  These strata are removed before computations begin.  Inclusion of these strata would not alter the permutation inference.  A message will indicate whether any strata have been removed; see StrataUse in the value section above.  You can avoid strata that do not contribute by using full matching in place of conventional stratification; see Rosenbaum (1991) and Hansen (2004) and R packages optmatch and sensitivityfull.
</p>
<p>The output produces a rejection or acceptance of the null hypothesis at a stated level=<code class="reqn">\alpha</code> in the presence of a bias of at most <code class="reqn">\Gamma</code>.  This statement is entirely safe, in the sense that it is at worst a tad conservative, falsely rejecting a true null hypothesis with probability at most <code class="reqn">\alpha</code> in the presence of a bias of at most <code class="reqn">\Gamma</code>.  To produce a true P-value, you would need to run the program several times to find the smallest level=<code class="reqn">\alpha</code> that leads to rejection, and the P-value produced in this standard way would share the property of the test in being, at worst, slightly conservative.  To save time, the output contains an approximate P-value that agrees with the accept/reject decision, but if this P-value is much smaller than the level &ndash; say, rejection at 0.05 with a P-value of 0.00048, then unlike the reject/accept decison, the 0.00048 P-value may not be conservative.  I have never found the approximate P-value to be misleading.  However, having seen an approximate P-value of 0.00048, it is easy to check whether you are formally entitled to reject at <code class="reqn">\alpha</code>=0.0005 by rerunning the program with level=0.0005 and basing the conclusion on the reject/accept decision at level <code class="reqn">\alpha</code>=0.0005.
</p>
<p>When there are many small strata, Gastwirth, Krieger and Rosenbaum (2000, GKR) proposed a separable approximation to the sensitivity bound.  In principle, this separable approximation is a tad liberal: it does not find the absolute worst unobserved covariate u, but rather a very bad u, such that as the number of strata increases the difference between the worst u and the very bad u becomes negligible.  The current function senstrat() improves upon the separable approximation in the following way.  This improvement is discussed in Rosenbaum (2017).  It makes a one-step linear Taylor correction to the separable approximation which is guaranteed to be slightly conservative, rather than slightly liberal, so it is always safe to use: it falsely rejects at level = 0.05 with probability at most 0.05 in the presence of a bias of at most <code class="reqn">\Gamma</code>.  More precisely, unlike the method of GKR, the one-step LinearBound correction does not require many small strata: in large samples, it falsely rejects at level=0.05 with probability at most 0.05 whether there are few or many strata, even if some of the strata are much larger than others.  If detail=FALSE, conclusions are based on the LinearBound without further comments.  This is reasonable, because the LinearBound is safe to use in all cases, being at worst slightly conservative.  If detail=TRUE, the LinearBound and the Separable approximation are compared.  Usually, the LinearBound and the Separable approximation yield conclusions that are very close, providing some reassurance that the LinearBound is not very conservative and the Separable approximation is not very liberal.  The option detail=TRUE is an aid to someone who wants to understand the LinearBound, but it is not a tool required for data analysis.
