<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Weighted Descriptive Statistics is an open source (LGPL 3) package for R which provides descriptive statistical methods to deal with weighted data. Assume that <code class="reqn">x=(x_1, x_2, \cdots , x_n)</code> is the observed value of a random sample from a fuzzy population. In classical and usual random sample, the degree of belonging <code class="reqn">x_i</code> into the random sample is equal to 1, for <code class="reqn">1 \leq i  \leq  n</code>.
But considering fuzzy population, we denote the degree of belonging <code class="reqn">x_i</code> into the fuzzy population (or into the observed value of random sample) by <code class="reqn">\mu_i</code> which is a real-valued number from [0,1].
Therefore in such situations, it is more appropriate that we show the observed value of the random sample by notation <code class="reqn"> \{ (x_1, \mu_1),  (x_2, \mu_2), \cdots , (x_n, \mu_n) \} </code> which we called it real-valued fuzzy data or weighted data.
Weighted descriptive statistics is the discipline of quantitatively describing the main features of a real-valued fuzzy data which usually given from a fuzzy population. 
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The weighted descriptive statistics provide a concise summary a set of real data  <code class="reqn">x=(x_1, x_2, \cdots , x_n)</code>  on the basis of the vector weight <code class="reqn">\mu=(\mu_1, \mu_2, \cdots , \mu_n)</code>. By Weighted.Desc.Stat package, one can easily summarize real-valued fuzzy data numerically or graphically using this package.
Calculating numerically summarize is possible by some weighted statistics in this package (such as mean, variance, covariance, correlation coefficent and etc) that summarize and interpret some of the properties of one or several sets of real-valued fuzzy data (real-valued fuzzy samples). Also, graphically interpretation can be drown by weighted histogram and weighted scatter plot using this package to describe properties of real-valued fuzzy data set.

<h3>Description</h3>

 
<p>Assume that <code class="reqn">x=(x_1, x_2, \cdots , x_n)</code> is the observed value of a random sample from a fuzzy population. 
In classical and usual random sample, the degree of belonging <code class="reqn">x_i</code> into the random sample is equal to 1, for <code class="reqn">1 \leq i  \leq  n</code>.
But considering fuzzy population, we denote the degree of belonging <code class="reqn">x_i</code> into the fuzzy population (or into the observed value of random sample) by <code class="reqn">\mu_i</code> which is a real-valued number from [0,1].
Therefore in such situations, it is more appropriate that we show the observed value of the random sample by notation <code class="reqn"> \{ (x_1, \mu_1),  (x_2, \mu_2), \cdots , (x_n, \mu_n) \} </code> which we called it real-valued fuzzy data.
The weighted scatter plot, or weighted scatterplot, is a type of mathematical diagram to display values of two real-valued fuzzy data sets (from two variables of fuzzy populations) by considering a vector-valued weight. In weighted scatter plot, this kind of data is displayed as a collection of circles, the center point of each having the value of one variable determining the position on the horizontal axis and the value of the other variable determining the position on the vertical axis. Also the radius of each circle is considered equal to (or a ratio from) the weight of correcponding two-dimentional element (the center of circle).
