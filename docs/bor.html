<h3>Description</h3>

<p>countb takes a data frame with dyadic social interactions' data (akin to that
returned by dtable function) and returns a list of asymmetric data matrices-
one for each observer and type of social interaction. Each matrix cell
provides counts on the number of times a specific type of social interaction
was initiated by the row subject and directed to the column subject.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>countb(x)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr><td><code id="countb_+3A_x">x</code></td>
<td>
<p>A data frame with 7 columns: the 1st column should refer to the
focal subject's identification code (e.g., column named &quot;id1&quot; as in the
output of dtable function); the 2nd column should refer to the
identification code of the interaction partner (e.g., &quot;id2&quot;); the
3rd column (e.g., &quot;sender_id1&quot;) should refer whether the focal subject was
the initiator (coded 1) or the target of the social interaction (coded 0);
the 4th column should refer to the type/code of social interaction
recorded; the 5th column (e.g., &quot;no_occurrence&quot;) should refer whether no
social interactions were recorded (coded as 1; NA's otherwise); the 6th
column (e.g., &quot;missing&quot;) should refer whether the focal subject was
unavailable for observation (coded as 1; NA's otherwise); the 7th columns
(e.g., &quot;observer&quot;) should refer to the observer's identification code.</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>countb returns a list with asymmetric matrices, one for each observer
and type of social interaction recorded. Matrix cells provide counts on the
number of times social interactions were initiated by the row subjects and
directed to the column subjects.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>## create list of asymmetric matrices (data2) from data object
## data object is obtained by converting raw focal observations' data in ex_field_data with
## dtable function
 b &lt;- c("+","-")

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>dtable takes a data frame containing raw focal observations' data and
transforms it into another data frame more suitable for further data
analysis.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>dtable(x, bset, bsep = ".", asep = ";", missing = "x", noc = "0")
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr><td><code id="dtable_+3A_x">x</code></td>
<td>
<p>data frame containing raw focal observations' data, referring to
dyadic social interactions. This data frame should contain one focal
observation per row and 3 columns. The first column should refer to focal's
subject identification code; the second, to the recorded dyadic social
interactions; and the third, to observer's identification code. See
ex_field_data for further details on the structure of this data frame.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="dtable_+3A_bset">bset</code></td>
<td>
<p>A vector specifying the codes of the recorded social
interactions.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="dtable_+3A_bsep">bsep</code></td>
<td>
<p>The separation character used in the second column of x to
separate subject's id code from social interactions code. Default is &quot;.&quot;.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="dtable_+3A_asep">asep</code></td>
<td>
<p>The separation character used in the second column of x to
separate different social interactions recorded within the same focal
sample. Default is &quot;;&quot;.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="dtable_+3A_missing">missing</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character, used in the second column of x, to identify focal
observations where the focal subject was unavailable for observation.
Default is &quot;x&quot;.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="dtable_+3A_noc">noc</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character, used in the second column of x, to identify focal
observations where no social interactions were recorded. Default is &quot;0&quot;.</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>dtable returns a data frame with 7 columns: &quot;id1&quot; identifies the
focal subject's; &quot;sender_id1&quot; identifies whether the focal's subject (id1)
was the initiator of the dyadic social interaction (coded 1), or the target
of the social interaction (coded 0; in this case the initiator is the
subject referred in the column &quot;id2&quot;); &quot;behavior&quot; identifies the social
interaction observed; if no social interactions were recorded in a focal
sample, &quot;no_occurrence&quot; and &quot;missing&quot; columns specify whether the focal
subject was observed but did not interact, or was unavailable for
observation, respectively; &quot;observer&quot; columns identifies the observer.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>## convert raw focal observations' data in ex_field_data
## see ?ex_field_data for further details
## bsep, asep, missing and noc arguments take default values (".", ";", "x", "0" respectively)
b &lt;- c("+","-")
data &lt;- dtable(ex_field_data, bset = b)
head(data)
</code></pre>

<h2 id='ex_field_data'>Example of raw focal observations' data</h2><span id='topic+ex_field_data'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A data frame containing an hypothetical (randomly generated) focal
observations' data set to be passed to dtable(). This example contains 100
focal samples in a group of 9 subjects.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>ex_field_data
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>Data frame containing raw focal observations' data, referring to
dyadic social interactions. This data frame contains one focal observation
per row and 3 columns:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>id1</dt><dd><p>focal subject's identification code.</p>
</dd>
<dt>act</dt><dd><p>recorded social interactions (SIs) in each focal sample.</p>
</dd>
<dt>obs</dt><dd><p>observer's identification code.</p>
</dd>
</dl>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>In this example two different SIs were recorded (coded + and -); SIs
codes, subjects' id codes, and separation characters should not overlap. The
. character is used to separate subjects' id codes from the SIs' codes, and
the ; character is used to separate different SIs occurring within the same
focal sample. Whenever a subject's id appears before a SI's code it means
that, that subject initiated a SI with the focal subject (see row 6);
whenever a subject's id appears after the SI's it means that the focal
subject (id1 column) initiated a SI with that subject (see row 4). For
example, the 4th row indicates that the focal subject s1 initiated a +
social interaction with subject s4, while the 6th row indicates that the
focal subject s5 was involved in two social interactions- the first
initiated by s4 (-), the second (+) initiated by s2. 0s in this column refer
to focal observations where no SIs were recorded, and xs refer to focal
observations where the focal subject was unavailable for observation.
