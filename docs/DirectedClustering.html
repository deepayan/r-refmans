Alternative Clustering Coefficients for Directed/Undirected and Weighted Networks
</h2><span id='topic+DirectedClustering'></span><span id='topic+DirectedClustering-package'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The <span class="pkg">DirectedClustering</span> <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span> package presented here includes an enhanced <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span> implementation of Local and Global (average) Clustering Coefficients for Directed/Undirected and Unweighted/Weighted Networks. <br /> Functions are based on Barrat et al. (2004) and Onnela et al. (2005) coefficients when the network is undirected, while it is based on Fagiolo (2007) and Clemente and Grassi (2018) proposals when the network is directed. In the directed case, different components of directed clustering coefficient are also considered.
</p>
<p>Details of alternative coefficients computed by <span class="pkg">DirectedClustering</span> <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span> package can be found in Clemente, Grassi (2018).
</p>
<p>Please report any issue arising or bug in the code to gianpaolo.clemente@unicatt.it.

<p>Formulas are based on Barrat et al. (2004) for undirected networks,

<p>The function computes the Barrat et al. (2004) coefficient for a weighted and undirected network.
For a directed network, the Clemente and Grassi (2018) formula is used.
In case of unweighted and undirected graphs, the classical local clustering coefficient (Watts and Strogatz) is provided.
Local clustering coefficients are computed for each node,
and the global coefficient is the average of these local coefficients.
These coefficients do not work for graphs with multiple or loop edges, hence loops are removed.

<h2 id='ClustF'>Clustering Coefficients for Directed/Undirected and Weighted Networks</h2><span id='topic+ClustF'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function computes both Local and Global (average) Clustering Coefficients for either Directed/Undirected and Unweighted/Weighted Networks.
The formulas are based on Onnela et al. (2005) for undirected networks,
and on Fagiolo (2007) for directed networks.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>ClustF(mat, type = "undirected", isolates = "zero", norm = 1)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table role = "presentation">
<tr><td><code id="ClustF_+3A_mat">mat</code></td>
<td>
<p>A weighted adjacency matrix. If weights are greater than one,
a normalization is provided by dividing each weight by the maximum weight observed.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="ClustF_+3A_type">type</code></td>
<td>
<p>The type of clustering coefficient to calculate.
Possible values are: <code>"undirected"</code> (default) or <code>"directed"</code>.</p>

</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="ClustF_+3A_norm">norm</code></td>
<td>
<p>If it is 1 (default), the link's weights are normalized by dividing by the maximum observed weight (as proposed by Fagiolo).
If it is 0, weights are not normalized. Weights are always normalized when the maximum weight is greater than zero, ensuring that the clustering coefficient ranges between 0 and 1.</p>
