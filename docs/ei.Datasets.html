<td>Description:</td>
<td>Provides more than 550 data sets of actual election results. 
    Each of the data sets includes aggregate party and candidate outcomes at the voting
    unit (polling stations) level and two-way cross-tabulated results at the district level.
    These data sets can be used to assess ecological inference algorithms devised 
    for estimating RxC (global) ecological contingency tables using exclusively aggregate results 
    from voting units.

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This tibble contains 69 data sets corresponding to the 2002 New Zealand General Election. Each data set includes party and candidate vote results by voting unit as well as their associate cross-distributions (for votes and percentages) at the district (electorate) level.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>data(ei_NZ_2002)</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A tibble containing 69 observations and 6 variables:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>Number_of_district</code></dt><dd><p>Number assigned to the district/electorate by the New Zealand Electoral Commission.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>District</code></dt><dd><p>Name of the district/electorate.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>Votes_to_parties</code></dt><dd><p>A tibble for each electorate/district with the party votes recorded in each voting unit of the district.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>Votes_to_candidates</code></dt><dd><p>A tibble for each electorate/district with the candidate votes recorded in each voting unit of the district.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>District_cross_votes</code></dt><dd><p>A tibble for each electorate/district with the parties-candidates cross-distribution of votes in the entire electorate/district.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>District_cross_percentages</code></dt><dd><p>A tibble for each electorate/district, with the parties to candidates voter transition probabilities (in percentages) in the entire electorate/district.</p>
</dd>
</dl>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Description of the <code>Votes_to_parties</code>, <code>Votes_to_candidates</code>, <code>District_cross_votes</code> and <code>District_cross_percentages</code> variables in more detail, where N(i), R(i) and C(i) denote, respectively, the number of voting units, party voting options and candidate voting options in district <code>i</code>:
</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>Votes_to_parties</code>: A list of 69 tibbles/data.frames, with each data.frame containing N(i) observations and 2+R(i) variables. The two first variables, <code>City</code> and <code>Address</code> inform, respectively, about the place in the district where the voting unit is located and the voting unit address. The rest of the columns correspond to the votes gained by the different party voting options competing in the district. The orders of the voting units in <code>Votes_to_parties</code> and <code>Votes_to_candidates</code> coincide.

</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>Votes_to_candidates</code>: A list of 69 tibbles/data.frames, with each data.frame containing N(i) observations and 2+C(i) variables. The two first variables, <code>City</code> and <code>Address</code> inform, respectively, about the place in the district where the voting unit is located and the voting unit address. The rest of the columns correspond to the votes gained by the different candidate voting options competing in the district. The orders of the voting units in <code>Votes_to_candidates</code> and <code>Votes_to_parties</code> coincide.
</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>District_cross_votes</code>: A list of 69 tibbles/data.frames, with each data.frame containing R(i) rows and 1+C(i) columns (variables). The first variable, which is labelled after the name of the district, contains the names of the parties in the same order than in corresponding <code>Votes_to_parties</code> tibble, the rest of the variables (columns), ordered as in the corresponding <code>Votes_to_candidates</code> tibble, are labelled as the candidate voting options.
</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>District_cross_percentages</code>: A list of 69 tibbles/data.frames, with each data.frame containing R(i) rows and 1+C(i) columns (variables). The first variable, which is labelled after the name of the district, contains the names of the parties in the same order than in corresponding <code>Votes_to_parties</code> tibble, the rest of the variables (columns), ordered as in the corresponding <code>Votes_to_candidates</code> tibble, are labelled as the candidate voting options.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h3>Note</h3>

<p>The New Zealand Electoral Commission had no involvement in preparing these data sets. The raw data has been pre-processed in order to guarantee their straighforward usefulness in ecological inference procedures. Some small discrepancies exist among the figures in <code>District_cross_percentages</code> and <code>District_cross_votes</code>. The percentages are a direct translation of the published data, whereas the vote counts have been adjusted using integer linear programming to make them congruents with the figures in <code>Votes_to_parties</code> and <code>Votes_to_candidates</code>.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Description of the <code>Votes_to_parties</code>, <code>Votes_to_candidates</code>, <code>District_cross_votes</code> and <code>District_cross_percentages</code> variables in more detail, where N(i), R(i) and C(i) denote, respectively, the number of voting units, party voting options and candidate voting options in district <code>i</code>:
</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>Votes_to_parties</code>: A list of 71 tibbles/data.frames, with each data.frame containing N(i) observations and 2+R(i) variables. The two first variables, <code>City</code> and <code>Address</code> inform, respectively, about the place in the district where the voting unit is located and the voting unit address. The rest of the columns correspond to the votes gained by the different party voting options competing in the district. The orders of the voting units in <code>Votes_to_parties</code> and <code>Votes_to_candidates</code> coincide.

<li><p><code>District_cross_votes</code>: A list of 71 tibbles/data.frames, with each data.frame containing R(i) rows and 1+C(i) columns (variables). The first variable, which is labelled after the name of the district, contains the names of the parties in the same order than in corresponding <code>Votes_to_parties</code> tibble, the rest of the variables (columns), ordered as in the corresponding <code>Votes_to_candidates</code> tibble, are labelled as the candidate voting options.
</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>District_cross_percentages</code>: A list of 71 tibbles/data.frames, with each data.frame containing R(i) rows and 1+C(i) columns (variables). The first variable, which is labelled after the name of the district, contains the names of the parties in the same order than in corresponding <code>Votes_to_parties</code> tibble, the rest of the variables (columns), ordered as in the corresponding <code>Votes_to_candidates</code> tibble, are labelled as the candidate voting options.

<h3>Note</h3>

<p>The New Zealand Electoral Commission had no involvement in preparing these data sets. The raw data has been pre-processed in order to guarantee their straighforward usefulness in ecological inference procedures. Some small discrepancies exist among the figures in <code>District_cross_percentages</code> and <code>District_cross_votes</code>. The percentages are a direct translation of the published data, whereas the vote counts have been adjusted using integer linear programming to make them congruents with the figures in <code>Votes_to_parties</code> and <code>Votes_to_candidates</code>.

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Merge small parties and also small candidates by, respectively, aggregating them
in the options 'Other parties votes' and 'Other candidates votes'.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>merge_small_options(x, min.party, min.candidate)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr><td><code id="merge_small_options_+3A_x">x</code></td>
<td>
<p>A tibble with the same components and structure as the tibbles in the <code>ei.Datasets</code> package.
For instance, like the ei_NZ_2020 object.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="merge_small_options_+3A_min.party">min.party</code></td>
<td>
<p>A number between 0 and 100. Those parties which individually did not reach
at least min.party% of the election-district vote are grouped in the option
‘Other parties votes’.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="merge_small_options_+3A_min.candidate">min.candidate</code></td>
<td>
<p>A number between 0 and 100. Those candidates which individually did not
reach at least min.candididate% of the election-district vote are grouped
in the option ‘Other candidates votes’.</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A tibble similar to <code>x</code> with small parties and candidates merged on, respectively, ‘Other parties votes’
and ‘Other candidates votes’, with <code>min.party</code> and <code>min.candidate</code> used to determine when an electoral
option is small.
