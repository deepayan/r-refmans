<h3>Description</h3>

<p>pricensitivitymeter is an implementation of the van Westendorp
Price Sensitivity Meter method to analyze consumer price
preferences and price sensitivity in R. Besides the estimation
of optimal price points and price ranges, it can also model
the optimal price in terms of reach or revenue (based on the
so-called Newton Miller Smith extension).

see <code><a href="#topic+psm_analysis">psm_analysis</a></code> and
<code><a href="#topic+psm_analysis_weighted">psm_analysis_weighted</a></code> (for weighted data).

Van Westendorp Price Sensitivity Meter Analysis (PSM)
</h2><span id='topic+psm_analysis'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>psm_analysis()</code> performs an analysis of consumer price
preferences and price sensitivity known as <b>van
Westendorp Price Sensitivity Meter (PSM)</b>. It takes respondent's
price preferences (from survey data) as an input and estimates
acceptable price ranges and price points. For a description of
the method see the <em>Details</em> section.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>psm_analysis(
  toocheap, cheap, expensive, tooexpensive,
  data = NA,
  validate = TRUE,
  interpolate = FALSE,
  interpolation_steps = 0.01,

  acceptable_range = "original",
  pi_cheap = NA, pi_expensive = NA,
  pi_scale = 5:1,
  pi_calibrated = c(0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0.1, 0),
  pi_calibrated_toocheap = 0, pi_calibrated_tooexpensive = 0
  )

all vectors).
</p>
<p>If the <code>toocheap</code> price was not assessed, a
variable/vector of NAs can be used instead. This
variable/vector needs to have the same length as the other
survey information. If <code>toocheap</code> is NA for all cases,
it is possible to calculate the Point of Marginal
Expensiveness and the Indifference Price Point, but it is
impossible to calculate the Point of Marginal Cheapness and
the Optimal Price Point.</p>

research companies. Here, the lower end of the price range
is defined as the intersection of the &quot;expensive&quot; and the
&quot;too cheap&quot; curves and the upper end of the price range is
defined as the intersection of the &quot;too expensive&quot; and the

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The Price Sensitivity Meter method for the analysis of consumer
price preferences was proposed by the Dutch economist Peter van
Westendorp in 1976 at the ESOMAR conference. It is a
survey-based approach that has become one of the standard price
acceptance measurement techniques in the market research
industry and is still widely used for during early-stage product
development.
</p>
<p>Price acceptance and price sensitivity are measured in van
Westendorp's approach by four open-ended survey questions:
</p>

<ul>
<li><p> At which price on this scale are you beginning to
experience ... (test-product) as cheap?
</p>
</li>
<li><p> At which price on this scale are you beginning to
experience ... (test-product) as expensive?
</p>
</li>
<li><p> At which price on this scale you are beginning to
experience ... (test-product) as too expensive &ndash; so that you
would never consider buying it yourself?
</p>
</li>
<li><p> At which price on this scale you are beginning to
experience ... (test-product) as too cheap &ndash; so that you say
&quot;at this price the quality cannot be good&quot;?
</p>
</li></ul>

<p>Respondents with inconsistent price preferences (e.g. &quot;cheap&quot;
price larger than &quot;expensive&quot; price) are usually removed from
the data set. This function has built-in checks to detect
invalid preference structures and removes those respondents from
the analysis by default.
</p>
<p>To analyze price preferences and price sensitivity, the method
uses cumulative distribution functions for each of the
aforementioned price steps (e.g. &quot;how many respondents think
that a price of <code>x</code> <em>or more</em> is expensive?&quot;). By
convention, the distributions for the &quot;too cheap&quot; and the
&quot;cheap&quot; price are inverted. This leads to the interpretation
&quot;how many respondents think that a price of <em>up to</em>
<code>x</code> is (too) cheap?&quot;.
</p>
<p>The interpretation is built on the analysis of the intersections
of the four cumulative distribution functions for the different
prices (usually via graphical inspection). The original paper
describes the four intersections as follows:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><b>Point of Marginal Cheapness (PMC)</b>: Below this price
point, there are more respondents that consider the price as
&quot;too cheap&quot; than respondents who consider it as &quot;not cheap&quot;
(intersection of &quot;too cheap&quot; and &quot;not cheap&quot;). This is interpreted
as the lower limit of the range of acceptable prices.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><b>Point of Marginal Expensiveness (PME)</b>. Above this
price point, there are more respondent that consider the price
as &quot;too expensive&quot; than there are respondents who consider it as
&quot;not expensive&quot; (intersection of &quot;not expensive&quot; and &quot;too
expensive&quot;). This is interpreted as the upper limit of the
range of acceptable prices.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><b>Indifference Price Point (IDP)</b>: The same number of
respondents perceives the price as &quot;cheap&quot; and &quot;expensive&quot;
(intersection of &quot;cheap&quot; and &quot;expensive&quot;). In van Westendorp's
interpretation, this is either the median price paid in the
market or the price of an important market-leader.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><b>Optimal Price Point (OPP)</b>: The same number of
respondents perceives the product as &quot;too cheap&quot; and &quot;too
expensive&quot; (intersection of &quot;too cheap&quot; and &quot;too expensive&quot;).
van Westendorp argues that this is the value for which the
respondents' resistance against the price is particularly low.
</p>
</li></ul>

<p>Besides those four intersections, van Westendorp's article
advises to analyze the cumulative distribution functions for
steep areas which indicate price steps.
</p>
<p>To analyze reach (trial rates) and estimate revenue forecasts,
Newton/Miller/Smith have extended van Westendorp's original
model by adding two purchase intent questions that are asked for
the respondent's &quot;cheap&quot; and &quot;expensive&quot; price. The purchase
probability at the respondent's &quot;too cheap&quot; and &quot;too expensive&quot;
price are defined as <code>0</code>. The main logic is that the &quot;too
expensive&quot; price point is prohibitively expensive for the
respondent and a price at the &quot;too cheap&quot; price level raises
doubts about the product quality.
</p>
<p>By combining the standard van Westendorp questions with those
two additional purchase intent questions, it becomes possible to
summarize the purchase probabilities across respondents (using
linear interpolation for the purchase probabilities between each
respondent's cornerstone prices). The maximum of this curve is
then defined as the price point with the highest expected reach.
Moreover, by multiplying the reach with the price, it also
becomes possible to estimate a price with the highest expected
revenue.
</p>
<p>It has to be noted that the van Westendorp Price Sensitivity
Meter is useful in some cases, but does not answer every
pricing-related question. It may be a good tool to assess very
broadly if the consumers' price perceptions exceed the actual
production costs. For more complex analyses (e.g. defining
specific prices for different products to avoid cannibalization
and drive at the same time incremental growth), other
methodological approaches are needed.

The lower end of the price range (point of marginal
cheapness) is defined as the intersection of &quot;too cheap&quot;
and the inverse of the &quot;cheap&quot; curve. The upper end of the
price range (point of marginal expensiveness) is defined
as the intersection of &quot;too expensive&quot; and the inverse of
the &quot;expensive&quot; curve. Alternatively, it is possible to use
a &quot;narrower&quot; definition which is applied by some market
research companies. Here, the lower end of the price range
is defined as the intersection of the &quot;expensive&quot; and the
&quot;too cheap&quot; curves and the upper end of the price range is
defined as the intersection of the &quot;too expensive&quot; and the

according to the Newton/Miller/Smith extension is higher
