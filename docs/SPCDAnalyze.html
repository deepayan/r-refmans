<td>Description:</td>
<td>Programs to find the sample size or power of studies using the 
    Sequential Parallel Comparison Design (SPCD) and programs to analyze 
    such studies. This is a clinical trial design where 
    patients initially on placebo who did not respond are re-randomized between 
    placebo and active drug in a second phase and the results of the two phases are 
    pooled. The method of analyzing binary data with this design is described in 
    Fava,Evins, Dorer and Schoenfeld(2003) &lt;<a href="https://doi.org/10.1159%2F000069738">doi:10.1159/000069738</a>&gt;, and the

<h2 id='placeboNonResponder'>Example of helper function for determining placebo nonresponse</h2><span id='topic+placeboNonResponder'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The input to <code>SPCDcontinuous</code> requires a logical field which says that the patient was not a placebo responder in the the first phase of the study. Usually this is determined by whether their outcome was greater than a specified value but could have other criteria.  This an example program which specifies non-responders as patients whose first phase results were greater than a constant.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>placeboNonResponder(data, ID = "ID", k = 0)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr><td><code id="placeboNonResponder_+3A_data">data</code></td>
<td>

<p>The data file to use to determine non-response.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="placeboNonResponder_+3A_id">ID</code></td>

<p>Text field indicating the name of the Patient ID variable.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="placeboNonResponder_+3A_k">k</code></td>
<td>

<p>A numeric constant.  A patient is a non-responder if their change from baseline was greater than k.
</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A new data frame with a variable named <code>nonResponder</code>.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>The choice of criteria should be specified in the protocol. One suggesting is to consider a non responder to be a patient who would still be eligible for the study.

<h2 id='runGls'>Runs a constrained longitudinal data analysis model for use with <code>SPCDcontinuous</code>
</h2><span id='topic+runGls'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p> The function <code>SPCDFcontinuous</code> requires an analysis function which estimates the treatment effect and it's standard error for each phase of the study. This function uses the so called cLDA model to analyze the data.  In the situation where their are only pre-test and post-test measurements this is roughly equivalent to an analysis of covariance.  This function can either be used as is or be used as a model for a user supplied function.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>runGls(combData, times = "time")
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr><td><code id="runGls_+3A_combdata">combData</code></td>
<td>
<p>This is the input file data file, it needs to have fields <code>ID</code> which is the patient identifier,
<code>time</code> which is the observation time, <code>y</code> the outcome variable, <code>trt</code> a treatment code which is either
<code>Placebo</code> or <code>Active</code>
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="runGls_+3A_times">times</code></td>
<td>

<p>This is the time variable. The set of times for each patient needs to be the same(except for some patients times may be missing).  If they are different then the <code>runSlopes</code> function might work.
</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A numerical vector of length 3 which gives the treatment effect, it's standard are and the z-score which is the ratio of the treatment effect to it's standard error. The function <code>SPCDcontinuous</code> will use the number of patients as the degrees of freedom to compute p-values.

<h2 id='runSlopes'>Runs a random slopes model for use with <code>SPCDcontinuous</code>
</h2><span id='topic+runSlopes'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The function <code>SPCDFcontinuous</code> requires an analysis function which estimates the treatment effect and it's standard error for each phase of the study. This function uses the random slopes model to analyze the data.This is a random effects model with a random slope and intercept for each patient. The treatment effect is the difference in the mean slopes which modeled as the time-treatment interaction.  This function can either be used as is or be used as a model for a user supplied function.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>runSlopes(combData, times = "time")
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>

<td>

<p>This is the input file data file, it needs to have fields <code>ID</code> which is the patient identifier,
<code>time</code> which is the observation time, <code>y</code> the outcome variable, <code>trt</code> a treatment code which is either

</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="runSlopes_+3A_times">times</code></td>
<td>

<p>This is the time variable.The observation time can be different for each patient.  If they are the same then the <code>runGls</code> function might also be appropriate.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This fits the random slopes model
<code class="reqn">y_{t}=\mu+\beta_1 t+ \beta_2 t*I(rx=1)+u+b t+\sigma \epsilon</code>,
where <code class="reqn">u,b,\epsilon</code> are random variables. Note that a treatment main effect is not included in the model by default, because in a randomized study the treatments should be the same at the baseline visit. This practice may vary.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A numerical vector of length 3 which gives the treatment effect, it's standard are and the z-score which is the ratio of the treatment effect to it's standard error. The function <code>SPCDcontinuous</code> will use the number of patients as the degrees of freedom to compute p-values.

A response criteria is determined and the phase 2 data of patients who respond in phase 1 is eliminated. Each phase is analyzed separately and the results are pooled.

This package includes two examples <code>runSlopes</code> which uses a random slopes effects model, with a random slope and intercept, where the time-treatment interaction is the measure of treatment effect and <code>runGls</code> which is a repeated measures model where there is not treatment effect at time 0 and the outcome is the treatment effect at the last observation time.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This program considers the situation in which response rates are supplied by the investigator, response is judged as by whether or not a continuous variable is greater than a constant, and the continuous variable is analyzed rather than the response variable. In this case it turns out the effect size for a comparison, where the response rates are <code>p</code> and <code>q</code> for placebo and active drug is <code>qnorm(1-p)-qnorm(1-q)</code>.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A numeric vector with the following fields, sample size <code>n</code>, Power for for the SPCD when using a dichotomous response outcome, Power for the SPCD using a continuous outcome where response is judged as a continuous variable being greater than a fixed constant, Power for a conventional design for a dichotomous variable and a continuous variable, Power for a SPCD design where the null is rejected if either the first phase or the second phase shows a significant difference. The first value is not corrected for multiple comparisons while the second uses a bonferroni correction.
