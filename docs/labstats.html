<h2 id='assay.window'>Data to calculate an assay window</h2><span id='topic+assay.window'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Simulated data for two variables to calculate an assay
window between positive and negative control samples.
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 40 rows and 3 variables:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>A:</dt><dd><p>Values for the first outcome variable.</p>
</dd>
<dt>B:</dt><dd><p>Values for the second outcome variable.</p>
</dd>
<dt>condition:</dt><dd><p>Indicates if a sample is a positive or
negative control.</p>
</dd>  </dl>

<hr>
<h2 id='block.covars'>Data to compare the use of blocking and covariate adjustment</h2><span id='topic+block.covars'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Simulated data to illustrate the effects of blocking
versus adjusting for a covariate.
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 8 rows and 6 variables:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>weight:</dt><dd><p>A baseline measurement of body weight for eight
rats. The rows of the data frame are sorted according to weight
(lightest to heaviest).</p>
</dd>
<dt>block:</dt><dd><p>Rats are grouped into four blocks based on body
weight.</p>
</dd>
<dt>RBD:</dt><dd><p>Treatment group when using a randomised block design
(RBD).</p>
</dd>
<dt>CRD:</dt><dd><p>Treatment group when using a completely randomised
design (CRD).</p>
</dd>
<dt>y.RBD:</dt><dd><p>Outcome variable under the RBD.</p>
</dd>
<dt>y.CRD:</dt><dd><p>Outcome variable under the CRD.</p>
</dd>
</dl>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The experimental manipulation is a new diet versus a
standard control diet and the outcome is the amount of food eaten
on each diet. Since rats that weigh more at the beginning of the
experiment are expected to eat more food, regardless of the diet,
it would be beneficial to account for this source of
variation. This can be done either through use of blocking or
covariate adjustment and data for both designs are included. Note
that only one design could be used in a real experiment but here we
generate outcome values for two experiments using the same baseline
body weight values.
</p>
<p>For the randomised block design the eight rats are ranked according to
baseline body weight and grouped into four blocks of two (the two
lightest rats form the first block, the next two the second, and so
on). Assignment to treatment group is done within blocks.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'># Randomised block design
summary(aov(y.RBD ~ factor(block) + RBD, data=block.covars))

# Completely randomised design with weight as a covariate
summary(aov(y.CRD ~ weight + CRD, data=block.covars))

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The data contains five samples with three measurements
made on each sample; these are &quot;technical replicates&quot; and do not
contribute to the sample size. Which of the two outcome variables,
A or B, would make a better primary outcome?

<hr>
<h2 id='festing'>Mouse liver enzyme randomised block design data set</h2><span id='topic+festing'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Sixteen mice from four strains were used; half were
assigned to the treated condition and half to the control. The
experiment was split into two batches, which were run two months
apart.
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 16 rows and 4 variables:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>strain:</dt><dd><p>Four strains of mice were used: NIH, BALB/c, A/J,
and 129/Ola.</p>
</dd>
<dt>treatment:</dt><dd><p>Presence or absence of diallyl sulphide.</p>
</dd>
<dt>batch:</dt><dd><p>The experiment was conducted in two batches.</p>
</dd>
<dt>value:</dt><dd><p>Levels of glutathione-S-transferase (Gst).</p>
</dd>  </dl>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The purpose of the experiment was to test if diallyl
sulphide (DS) affects the activity of the liver enzyme Gst. Four
strains of mice were used and the experiment was conducted in two
batches, where the housing conditions differed between
batches. Both batch and strain are considered blocking variables.

<h2 id='fluoxetine'>Fluoxetine data set</h2><span id='topic+fluoxetine'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Twenty rats were given fluoxetine and tested in the
forced swim test (FST).
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 20 rows and 2 variables:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>dose:</dt><dd><p>Dose of fluoxetine (0, 80, 160, or 240 mg/L).</p>
</dd>
<dt>time.immob:</dt><dd><p>Total immobility time in the FST (seconds).</p>
</dd> </dl>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Twenty rats were randomly assigned to a control condition
or three doses of fluoxetine. Fluoxetine was administered in the
drinking water. The amount of time the rats were immobile in the
FST was measured and greater immobility time implies a more
depressive phenotype.

liver was divided into three pieces.</p>

and two measurements were taken on each piece for 6 x 3 x 2 = 36
observations. The rats are the experimental units and there are two
levels of subsampling.

pregnant females and their offspring.
</p>
<p>This is a subset of the full data set from Mehta et al., which
contained fourteen litters. The litters were selected to have an
equal sample size across all conditions for illustrative
purposes. The complete data can be found in the supplementary
material of Lazic and Essioux (2013).
