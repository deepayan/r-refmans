<td>Implements variable screening techniques for ultra-high
    dimensional regression settings.  Techniques for independent (iid) data,
    varying-coefficient models, and longitudinal data are implemented. The package
     currently contains three screen functions: screenIID(), screenLD() and screenVCM(),
     and six methods for simulating dataset: simulateDCSIS(), simulateLD, simulateMVSIS(),
     simulateMVSISNY(), simulateSIRS() and simulateVCM(). The package is based on the work of

<h2 id='screenIID'>Feature Selection for Ultrahigh-Dimensional Datasets with Independent Subjects,</h2><span id='topic+screenIID'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Implements one of three screening procedures: Sure Independent Ranking and
Screening (SIRS), Distance Correlation Sure Independence Screening (DC-SIS), or
MV Sure Independence Screening (MV-SIS).  In general they are extensions of the sure
independence screening concept proposed by Fan and Lv (2008), but without a parametric
assumption (e.g., linear or logistic) on the relationship between the predictor variables X
and outcome Y.
</p>
<p>Screening methods each rank the predictors based on some measure
of their estimated strength of relationship with Y.  The assumption is that only a few
among the top-ranked variables are likely to be truly significant predictors.
</p>
<p>The original version of SIS involved ranking the predictors by their correlation
with Y, implying a linear relationship.  The SIRS method is an extension proposed
by Zhu, Li, Li, &amp; Zhu (2011), which involved ranking the predictors by their
correlation with the rank-ordered Y instead, thereby not assuming a linear
correlation, and potentially outperforming SIS.
</p>
<p>DC-SIS was then proposed by Li, Zhong and Zhu (2012) and its relationship measure is
the distance correlation (DC) between a covariate and the outcome, a nonparametric
generalization of the correlation coefficient (Szekely, Rizzo, &amp; Bakirov, 2007).
The function uses the dcor function from the R package energy in order to
calculate this correlation.  Simulations showed that DC-SIS could sometimes provide a further
advantage over SIRS.
</p>
<p>The above measures were primarily intended for a numerical Y.  Cui, Li, and Zhong (2015)
proposed MV-SIS, which was developed for categorical Y (including binary Y) as in
discriminant analysis, and which is also robust to heavy-tailed predictor distributions.
The measure used by MV-SIS for the association strength between a particular Xk and Y is a
mean conditional variance measure called MV for short,  namely the expectation in X of
the variance in Y of the conditional cumulative distribution function F(x|Y)=P(X&lt;=x|Y);
note that like the correlation or distance correlation, this is zero if X and Y are
independent because F(x) does not depend on Y in that case.  Cui, Li, and Zhong (2015)
also point out that the MV-SIS can alternatively be used with categorical X variables
and numerical Y, instead of numerical X and categorical Y.  This function supports that
option as &quot;MV-SIS-NY.&quot;
</p>
<p>Whichever option is chosen, the function returns the ranking of the predictors according
to the appropriate association measure.
</p>
<p>The function code is adapted from the relevant authors' code.  Special thanks are due to
Wei Zhong for providing some of the code upon which this function is based.

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Simulates a dataset that can be used to demonstrate variable screening
for ultrahigh-dimensional regression with the DC-SIS option in screenIID.
The simulated dataset has p numerical predictors X and a categorical Y-response.
The data-generating scenario is a simplified version of Example 3.1a (homoskedastic) or 3.1d
(heteroskedastic) of  Li, Zhong &amp; Zhu (2012).
Specifically, the X covariates are normally distributed with mean zero and variance one, and
may be correlated if the argument rho is set to a nonzero value.  The response Y is generated as
either
Y = 6*X1 + 1.5*X2  + 9*1X12 &lt; 0 + exp(2*X22)*e
if heteroskedastic=TRUE, or
Y = 6*X1 + 1.5*X2  + 9*1X12 &lt; 0 + 6*X22 + e
if heteroskedastic=FALSE, where e is a standard normal error term and 1 is a zero-one
indicator function for the truth of the statement contained.

<h2 id='simulateSIRS'>Simulate a dataset for demonstrating the performance of screenIID with the SIRS method</h2><span id='topic+simulateSIRS'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Simulates a dataset that can be used to demonstrate variable screening
for ultrahigh-dimensional regression with the SIRS option in screenIID.
The simulated dataset has p numerical predictors X and a categorical Y-response.
The data-generating scenario is a simplified version of Example 1 of  Zhu, Li, Li and Zhu (2011).
Specifically, the X covariates are normally distributed with mean zero and variance one, and
may be correlated if the argument rho is set to a nonzero value.  The response Y is generated as
Y = c*X1 + 0.8*c*X2 + 0.6*c*X3 + 0.4*c*X4 + 0.5*c*X5 + sigma*e.
where c is the argument SignalStrength, e is either a standard normal
distribution (if HeavyTailedResponse==FALSE) or t distribution with 1 degree of
freedom (if HeavyTailedResponse==TRUE). sigma is either sqrt(6.83) if heteroskedastic==FALSE,
or else exp(X20+X21+X22) if  heteroskedastic=TRUE.
