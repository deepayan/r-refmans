<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The typical state space for softball involves 25 states 
defined by the base situation (runners on base) and number of outs.  The
standard base situations are: (1) bases empty, (2) runner on first, (3) runner 
on second, (4) runner on third, (5) runners on first and second, (6) runners 
on second and third, (7) runners on first and third, and (8) bases loaded.
These 8 states are crossed with each of three out states (0 outs, 1 out, or 
2 outs) to form 24 states.  The final 25th state is the 3 outs that marks
the end of an inning.
</p>
<p>We expand these 25 states to incorporate &quot;fast&quot; players.  We make the following 
assumptions concerning fast players:
</p>

<ul>
<li><p> If a fast player is on first and the batter hits a single, the fast
player will stretch to third base (leaving the batter on first).
</p>
</li>
<li><p> If a fast player is on second and the batter hits a single, the fast
player will stretch home (leaving the batter on first and a single run scored).
</p>
</li>
<li><p> If a fast player is on first and the batter hits a double, the fast
player will stretch home (leaving the batter on second base and a single run scored).
</p>
</li>
<li><p> A typical player (not fast) who successfully steals a base will become 
a fast player for the remainder of that inning (meaning that a player 
who successfully steals second base will stretch home on a single).
</p>
</li></ul>

<p>Based on these assumptions, we add base situations that designate runners on first
and second base as either typical runners (R) or fast runners (F).  The entirety 
of these base situations can be viewed using <code>plot.chain</code> with <code>fast = TRUE</code>.
Aside from these fast player assumptions, runners advance bases as expected (a single
advances each runner one base, a double advances each runner two bases, etc.).
</p>
<p>Each at bat results in a change to the base situation and/or the number of outs.  The 
outcomes of an at-bat are limited to:
</p>

<ul>
<li><p> batter out (O): base state does not change, outs increase by one
</p>
</li>
<li><p> single (S): runners advance accordingly, score may increase, outs do not change
</p>
</li>
<li><p> double (D): runners advance accordingly, score may increase, outs do not change
</p>
</li>
<li><p> triple (TR): runners advance accordingly, score may increase, outs do not change
</p>
</li>
<li><p> homerun (HR): bases cleared, score increases accordingly, outs do not change
</p>
</li>
<li><p> walk (W): runners advance accordingly, score may increase, outs do not change
</p>
</li></ul>

<p>The transitions resulting from these outcomes are stored in &quot;transition matrices.&quot;  We 
utilize separate transition matrices for typical batters and fast batters (in order to 
keep fast runners designated separately).  We additionally incorporate stolen bases.
Steals are handled separately than the six at-bat outcomes because they do not result 
in changes to the batter.  Following softball norms, we only entertain steals of second
base.  Steals are considered in cases when there is a runner on first and no runner on second.
In this situation, steal possibilities are limited to:
</p>

<ul>
<li><p> no steal attempt: base situation and outs do not change
</p>
</li>
<li><p> successful steal: runner advances to second base
</p>
</li>
<li><p> caught steal: runner is removed, outs increase by one
</p>
</li></ul>

<p>Steal possibilities are implemented in separate transition matrices.  All transition 
matrices are stored as internal RData files.
</p>
<p>The <code>stats</code> input must be a data frame containing player probabilities.  It must 
contain columns &quot;O&quot;, &quot;S&quot;, &quot;D&quot;, &quot;TR&quot;, &quot;HR&quot;, and &quot;W&quot; whose entries are probabilities summing
to one, corresponding to the probability of a player's at-bat resulting in each outcome.
The data frame must contain either a &quot;NAME&quot; or &quot;NUMBER&quot; column to identify players (these
must correspond to the <code>lineup</code>).  Extra rows for players not in the lineup will be ignored.
This data frame may be generated from player statistics using <code>prob_calc</code>.
</p>
<p>The <code>stats</code> data frame may optionally include an &quot;SBA&quot; (stolen base attempt) column
that provides the probability a given player will attempt a steal (provided they are on first
base with no runner on second).  If &quot;SBA&quot; is specified, the data frame must also include 
a &quot;SB&quot; (stolen base) column that provides the probability of a given player successfully
stealing a base (conditional on them attempting a steal).  If these probabilities are not 
specified, calculations will not involve any steals.
</p>
<p>The <code>stats</code> data frame may also include a logical &quot;FAST&quot; column that indicates
whether a player is fast.  If this column is not specified, the &quot;FAST&quot; designation
will be assigned based on each player's &quot;SBA&quot; probability.  Generally, players who are more 
likely to attempt steals are the fast players.
</p>
<p>The <code>cycle</code> parameter is a useful tool for evaluating an entire lineup.  Through the course 
of a game, any of the nine players may lead-off an inning.  A weighted or un-weighted average 
of these nine expected scores provides a more holistic representation of the lineup than 
the expected score based on a single lead-off.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list of the S3 class &quot;<code>chain</code>&quot; with the following elements:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>lineup</code>: copy of input lineup
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>stats</code>: copy of input stats
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>score_full</code>: list of matrices containing expected score by 
each base/out state and the number of at-bats (created by matrix powers).  
List index corresponds to lead-off batter.  Rows of matrix correspond to 
base/out states.  Each column represents an additional matrix power.  Used
to assess convergence of the chain (through convergence of each row).
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>score_state</code>: matrix of expected score at the completion of
an inning based on starting base/out state.  Rows correspond to initial state;
columns correspond to lead-off batter.  Equal to the final column of 
<code>score_full</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>score</code>: vector of expected score for an entire inning (starting 
from zero runners and zero outs).  Index corresponds to lead-off batter.  
Equal to the first row of <code>score_state</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>time</code>: computation time in seconds
</p>
</li></ul>

</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function generates three types of plots:
</p>

<ul>
<li><p> Type 1: Plots chain convergence.  Each line corresponds to the 
expected score from a specific initial base/out state as at-bats
are accumulated.  If the chain has reached convergence, each line 
should level off.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Type 2: Plots expected score by initial base/out state.  This 
plot can be used to compare different states (e.g. is it better to have
a runner on second and one out or a runner on first and no outs?).  
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Type 3: Plots expected score for an inning based on lead-off batter.
Requires a <code>chain</code> object that was created with <code>cycle = TRUE</code>.
The average across all lead-off batters is the most holistic metric for 
comparing different lineups.
</p>
</li></ul>

<p>Both type 1 and type 2 plots rely on the specification of a lead-off batter.
In states with runners on base and/or outs, the lead-off batter refers to the
first batter to come up to to the plate starting in that situation, not 
the first batter to start the inning.  The &quot;true&quot; lead-off batter at the 
start of the inning corresponds to the R0 (no runners) 0 out case.
</p>

<h2 id='prob_calc'>Calculates player probabilities given players' game statistics.</h2><span id='topic+prob_calc'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Uses player statistics to calculate the probability of six
possible at bat outcomes (walk, single, double, triple, homerun, or out).
Also estimates the probability of a player attempting a steal (SBA) and
succeeding in an attempted steal (SB).  Player game statistics are 
commonly available on team's public webpages.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>prob_calc(playerData)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr><td><code id="prob_calc_+3A_playerdata">playerData</code></td>
<td>
<p>data frame of the players statistics (details below)</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The <code>playerData</code> data frame must contain the following columns 
of player statistics:
</p>

<ul>
<li><p> Name: player name
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Number: player number
</p>
</li>
<li><p> AB: at bats
</p>
</li>
<li><p> BB: walks
</p>
</li>
<li><p> HBP: hit by pitch
</p>
</li>
<li><p> H: hits
</p>
</li>
<li><p> 2B: doubles
</p>
</li>
<li><p> 3B: triples
</p>
</li>
<li><p> HR: homeruns
</p>
</li>
<li><p> ATT: attempted steals
</p>
</li>
<li><p> SB: successfully stolen bases
</p>
</li></ul>

<p>Plate appearances (PA) are calculated 
as AB + BB + HBP.  The player probabilities are calculated as:
</p>

<ul>
<li><p> Walk probability: W = (BB + HBP) / (PA) 
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Single probability: S = (H - (2B + 3B + HR)) / (PA) 
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Double probability: D = 2B / PA
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Triple probability: TR = 3B / PA
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Home Run probability: HR = HR / PA
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Out probability: O = (PA - (H + BB + HBP)) / PA
</p>
</li></ul>

<p>Probabilities calculated from limited at bats will not be very useful.  Note, 
this function does not assign TRUE/FALSE values for fast players.  These may
be manually assigned or will be assigned based on SBA probability when <code>chain</code> 
or <code>sim</code> functions are called.
</p>
<p>SBA (Stolen Base Attempt) is the probability a player will attempt to steal given they
are on first base and there is no runner on second. As a default, we estimate a player's
SBA probability using a rough thresholding rule based on the team's overall SB probability 
and the player's SB probability.  Essentially, we group the players into three categories: 
</p>

<ul>
<li><p> Almost Always Attempt to Steal Group: These players receive the SBA  probability of 
the team's overall SB probability which is calculated as (Team's total # of SB)/(Team's total # of SBA)
</p>
</li>
<li><p> 50/50 Attempt to Steal Group: These players receive SBA  probability of 0.50
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Never Attempt to Steal Group: These players receive SBA  probability of 0.0
</p>
</li></ul>

<p>We recommend reviewing these default probabilities before proceeding with run expectancy
calculations.
</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>In each simulation, we determine each batter's hit results
through a multinomial random trial where the probability of walk (W), single (S), 
double (D), triple (TR), home run (HR), and batter out (O) are assigned per input player 
statistics. We incorporate the impact of &quot;fast&quot; players through the following assumptions: 
</p>

<ul>
<li><p> If a fast player is on first and the batter hits a single, the fast
player will stretch to third base (leaving the batter on first).
</p>
</li>
<li><p> If a fast player is on second and the batter hits a single, the fast
player will stretch home (leaving the batter on first and a single run scored).
</p>
</li>
<li><p> If a fast player is on first and the batter hits a double, the fast
player will stretch home (leaving the batter on second base and a single run scored).
</p>
</li>
<li><p> A typical player (not fast) who successfully steals a base will become 
a fast player for the remainder of that inning (meaning that a player 
who successfully steals second base will stretch home on a single).
</p>
</li></ul>

<p>Aside from these fast player assumptions, runners advance bases as expected (a single
advances each runner one base, a double advances each runner two bases, etc.).
</p>
<p>Following softball norms, we only entertain steals of second base.  Steals are considered
in cases when there is a runner on first and no runner on second.  In these situations,
we use a bernoulli coin flip (based on the runner's SBA probability) to determine whether the
runner on first will attempt a steal.  In practice, these decisions are commonly left up to coaches.
If it is decided that the player will attempt a steal, a second bernoulli coin flip (based
on the runner's SB probability) determines whether the steal was successful or whether the player was
caught stealing.
</p>
<p>The <code>stats</code> input must be a data frame containing player probabilities.  It must 
contain columns &quot;O&quot;, &quot;S&quot;, &quot;D&quot;, &quot;TR&quot;, &quot;HR&quot;, and &quot;W&quot; whose entries are probabilities summing
to one, corresponding to the probability of a player's at-bat resulting in each outcome.
The data frame must contain either a &quot;NAME&quot; or &quot;NUMBER&quot; column to identify players (these
must correspond to the <code>lineup</code>).  Extra rows for players not in the lineup will be ignored.
This data frame may be generated from player statistics using <code>prob_calc</code>.
</p>
<p>The <code>stats</code> data frame may optionally include an &quot;SBA&quot; (stolen base attempt) column
that provides the probability a given player will attempt a steal (provided they are on first
base with no runner on second).  If &quot;SBA&quot; is specified, the data frame must also include 
a &quot;SB&quot; (stolen base) column that provides the probability of a given player successfully
stealing a base (conditional on them attempting a steal).  If these probabilities are not 
specified, calculations will not involve any steals.
</p>
<p>The <code>stats</code> data frame may also include a logical &quot;FAST&quot; column that indicates
whether a player is fast.  If this column is not specified, the &quot;FAST&quot; designation
will be assigned based on each player's &quot;SBA&quot; probability.  Players who are more 
likely to attempt steals are likely the fast players.
</p>
<p>As a default, simulations will be processed in parallel over all but one of the 
maximum available cores.  Parallelization is recommended to reduce computation time.
Interactive plotting (<code>graphic = TRUE</code>) requires no parallelization and will 
override specified cores with <code>cores = 1</code>.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list of the S3 class &quot;<code>sim</code>&quot; with the following elements:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>lineup</code>: copy of input lineup
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>stats</code>: copy of input stats
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>inn</code>: copy of input innings
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>score</code>: a vector containing the scores per each rep (game) 
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>score_avg_game</code>: the average expected score per rep (game). That is, <code>mean(score)</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>score_avg_inn</code>: the average expected score per rep (game) per inning. 
That is, <code>mean(score)/inn</code>. If <code>inn = 1</code>, then <code>score_avg_game = score_avg_inn</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>time</code>: computation time in seconds 
</p>
</li></ul>



<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'># Short simulation (designed to run in less than 5 seconds)

<h2 id='wku_stats'>Player statistics and probabilities for WKU softball</h2><span id='topic+wku_stats'></span><span id='topic+wku_probs'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Statistics and calculated probabilities for each player on 
the 2013 Western Kentucky University softball team. Data is stored in 
two data frames: <code>wku_stats</code> contains the game statistics for 
each player and <code>wku_probs</code> contains the calculated probabilities 
for each player.  Player names and numbers have been replaced with 
random letters/numbers to preserve anonymity.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>wku_stats

wku_probs
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>An object of class <code>tbl_df</code> (inherits from <code>tbl</code>, <code>data.frame</code>) with 18 rows and 23 columns.
</p>
<p>An object of class <code>spec_tbl_df</code> (inherits from <code>tbl_df</code>, <code>tbl</code>, <code>data.frame</code>) with 18 rows and 11 columns.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>wku_stats</code> contains the raw player data taken from the 2013 WKU
softball team's webpage.  <code>wku_probs</code> contains the 
player probabilities calculated using <code>prob_calc</code>.  Together, they provide
an example of calculating probabilities from player statistics.  See 
<code>?prob_calc</code> for more details on the columns of the two data frames.
</p>
<p><code>wku_probs</code> is designed for use with <code>chain</code> and <code>sim</code>.  It 
additionally contains a <code>fast</code> column that indicates whether each player is
considered fast.  This column is not necessary for running <code>chain</code> 
and <code>sim</code>, since it is equivalent to the default assignments.
