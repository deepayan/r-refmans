<h2 id='adventr'>adventr: tutorials in R for An Adventure in Statistics (Field, 2016).</h2><span id='topic+adventr'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The adventr package contains a series of tutorials that accompany my books <a href="https://www.discoveringstatistics.com/books/an-adventure-in-statistics/">An Adventure in Statistics</a>
and <a href="https://www.discoveringstatistics.com/books/discovering-statistics-using-r/">Discovering statistics using R</a>. These tutorials contain abridged sections from my books so there
are some copyright considerations but I offer them under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License</a>. (Basically you can
use them for teaching and non-profit activities but not meddle with them or claim them as your own work.)
</p>


<h3>Who is the package aimed at?</h3>

<p>Anyone teaching from or reading <a href="https://www.discoveringstatistics.com/books/an-adventure-in-statistics/">An Adventure in Statistics</a> or <a href="https://www.discoveringstatistics.com/books/discovering-statistics-using-r/">Discovering statistics using R</a> might find them useful.
</p>


<h3>What is covered?</h3>

<p>The tutorials <em>do not</em> teach the background theory (the books do): it is assumed you have either attended my lecture or read the relevant chapter in the aforementioned books (or someone else's)
The aim of this tutorial is to augment the theory that you already know by guiding you through fitting linear models using R and RStudio and asking you questions to test your knowledge along the way.
</p>


<h3>Running a tutorial</h3>

<p>To run a tutorial execute:
</p>
<p><code>learnr::run_tutorial("name_of_tutorial", package = "adventr")</code>
</p>
<p>replacing <em>name_of_tutorial</em> with the name of the tutorial (see below). For example, to run the tutorial on data basics execute:
</p>
<p><code>learnr::run_tutorial("adventr_02", package = "adventr")</code>
</p>

<h2 id='alice_dat'>Alice's gene data</h2><span id='topic+alice_dat'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A dataset relating to the following fictitious experiment:
Participants who had facial burns were recruited. One-week pre-test, a gene C-10XFMG (the so-called chameleon gene)
was introduced into all participants.Two days prior to test, a genetic toggle switch was introduced into half of the participants.
Half of the participants were asked to look at a photograph of themselves from before their injury and to imagine the cells in their faces
changing to become like the photo. The remainder acted as a control and were asked to look at a picture of a same-sex stranger and to try
to change their face to become the person in the picture. All participants looked at the picture for 6 sessions of 20 minutes each.
At the end of the sessions their faces were scanned into a computer and compared to the face in the photograph.
Facial recognition software produced a precise resemblance measure as a percentage (100
in the photograph, 0
The data are taken from Chapter 17 of Field, A. P. (2016). An adventure in statistics: the reality enigma. London: Sage.

<h2 id='calcite_dat'>Calcite mask data</h2><span id='topic+calcite_dat'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A dataset relating to the following fictitious experiment, which is an extension of the invisibility paste data described elsewhere:
&quot;... we asked whether we could manipulate the face perceived by the participant when viewing someone wearing calcite invisibility paste.
Participants were all so-called Chippers, who had ID chips installed in their brains. Each participant met 40 people who had calcite paste
on their face. For each of these people we took a photo of their face (the 'actual' face), and found a photo of a different face matched for
sex and age (the 'different' face). We could send these images to the participant's visual cortex using their ID chip.
For 20 of the encounters an image of the person's 'actual' face was transmitted to the participant's ID chip during the encounter, for the remaining
20 encounters the 'different' face was sent to the chip. During each encounter the participant was shown the photos of the actual and different face
and pointed to the one depicting whom they thought they had just met. As in Experiment 1, participants scored a point for each person they correctly
identified: a score of 0 would mean that they never chose the correct photo, a score of 20 would mean that they always chose the correct photo.&quot;
The data are taken from Chapter 15 of Field, A. P. (2016). An adventure in statistics: the reality enigma. London: Sage.

<h2 id='implant_dat'>Memory implanting data</h2><span id='topic+implant_dat'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A dataset relating to the following fictitious experiment:
&quot;We wanted to see whether our failure to replace memories was due to the type of conflicting information used. Five participants engaged in
three different scripted encounters with strangers during which 10 unusual things happened. After each encounter participants were asked to
privately recall what had happened. During the period of recall for one encounter they were left alone (control), during the recall of another
their ID chip was used to implant a verbal description of the encounter in which the 10 unusual events were replaced with different events, and
during the recall of the final encounter their ID chip was used to implant visual images of 10 different things to what they actually experienced.
Each participant, therefore, experienced three encounters and a different type of recall manipulation followed each one; the type of manipulation
associated with a particular encounter was counterbalanced. Finally, participants recalled the event for a second time and we measured how many
of the 10 unusual events that they originally experienced that they could recall.&quot;
The data are taken from Chapter 16 of Field, A. P. (2016). An adventure in statistics: the reality enigma. London: Sage.

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A dataset relating to the following fictitious experiment:
&quot;Twenty-eight participants were tested individually. Each participant sat on a revolving chair in the middle of a circle of 20 people.
The 20 people all wore a light deflecting aid on their face. For half of the participants (N = 14) the 20 people wore a standard calcite-based mask,
whereas the other half (N = 14) saw people wearing 'invisibility paste', a transparent cream containing calcite micro-crystals.
Participants looked at each person and were given two photographs, one depicting the person they were looking at and one depicting a different
person matched for age and sex. Participants had to decide which person they were looking at, before turning to the next person and being given
two different photographs. Participants scored a point for each person they identified correctly: a score of 0 would mean they always chose the
incorrect photo, a score of 20 would mean that they always chose the correct photo.&quot;

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A dataset relating to the following fictitious experiment from Chapter 16 of Field, A. P. (2016). An adventure in statistics: the reality enigma. London: Sage:
&quot;Thirty-six participants with ID chips were tested individually. All participants met a stranger who had a 5-minute scripted conversation with
them containing 10 critical pieces of information. A week later, the participants were asked to recall the encounter for 5 minutes, and then after
a 10-minute break wrote everything that they could remember about the original encounter. During the 5-minute initial recall, one of three things
happened: the control group (N = 12) received no intervention; the erase group (N = 12) had a pulse of electricity sent to their brain via their
ID chip; and the replace group (N = 12) had conflicting verbal descriptions sent to their ID chip. The outcome was how many of the 10 critical
pieces of information the participants wrote down after the recall phase.&quot;

<p>A dataset not from Field, A. P. (2016). An adventure in statistics: the reality enigma. London: Sage, but continuing the theme of the story. At the end of the book
it is revealed that Alice used her C-gene therapy to restore the code 1318 workers to a human state. This dataset relates to her third attempt. It contains data from 400 code 1318 workers.
Workers were randomly assigned to two arms of a trial (C-gene therapy and C-gene therapy with a toggle switch). They were also given one of five different doses of C-gene: 0 (no dose) or 1, 2, 3, or 4 doses.
The outcome was whether (or not) the worker had fully recovered after the treatment.

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A dataset not from Field, A. P. (2016). An adventure in statistics: the reality enigma. London: Sage, but continuing the theme of the story. At the end of the book
it is revealed that Alice used her C-gene therapy to restore the code 1318 workers to a human state. This dataset relates to her first attempt. It contains data from
190 code 1318 workers treated at 10 different clinics. Workers were randomly assigned to two arms of the trial (wait list vs.C-gene therapy) and the outcome was
how much they resembled their pre-zombie state (as a percentage). The zombification occurred as a result of these workers entering JIG:SAWs genetic enhancement programme (GEP),
and additional variables quantify how long it has been since they entered this programme (i.e., how long have they been a zombie) and whether they were originally
exposed to the low- or high-intensity GEP.

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A dataset not from Field, A. P. (2016). An adventure in statistics: the reality enigma. London: Sage, but continuing the theme of the story. At the end of the book
it is revealed that Alice used her C-gene therapy to restore the code 1318 workers to a human state. This dataset relates to her second attempt. It contains data from
