Principal Orthogonal ComplEment Thresholding (POET) method
</h2><span id='topic+POET'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Estimates large covariance matrices in approximate factor models by 
thresholding principal orthogonal complements.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>POET(Y, K, C, thres, matrix)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table role = "presentation">
<tr><td><code id="POET_+3A_y">Y</code></td>
<td>

<p>p by n matrix of raw data, where p is the dimensionality, n
is the sample size. It is recommended that Y is de-meaned,
i.e., each row has zero mean. 
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="POET_+3A_k">K</code></td>
<td>
<p>number of factors. K is pre-determined by the users. Default value
is set at the average value obtained from the Hallin&amp;Liska and Bai&amp;Ng methods.
Suggestions on choosing K:
</p>
<p>A simple way of determining K is to count the number of very spiked
(much larger than others) eigenvalues of the p by p sample covariance matrix of Y. 
</p>
<p>A formal data-driven way of determining K is described in
Bai and Ng (2002):&quot;Determining the number of factors in approximate factor
models&quot;, Econometrica, 70, 191-221. This procedure requires a one-dimensional optimization.
</p>
<p>POET is very robust to over-estimating K. But under-estimating K
can result to VERY BAD performance. Therefore we strongly recommend
choosing a relatively large K (normally less than 8) to avoid
missing any important common factor.
</p>
<p>K=0 corresponds to threshoding the sample covariance directly.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="POET_+3A_c">C</code></td>
<td>
<p>the positive constant for thresholding, user-specified. 
Default value is set at C=0.5
Our experience shows that C=0.5 performs quite well for soft thresholding.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="POET_+3A_thres">thres</code></td>
<td>
<p>choice of thresholding. Users can choose from three
thresholding methods:
</p>
<p>'soft': soft thresholding
</p>
<p>'hard' hard thresholding
</p>
<p>'scad': scad thresholding
</p>
<p>'alasso': adaptive lasso thresholding
</p>
<p>Default value is set at thres='soft'.
</p>
<p>Details are found in Rothman et al. (2009):
&quot;Generalized thresholding of large covariance matrices.&quot; JASA, 104, 177-186  
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="POET_+3A_matrix">matrix</code></td>
<td>
<p>the option of thresholding either correlation or covairance matrix.
Users can choose from:
</p>
<p>'cor': threshold the error correlation matrix then transform back to
covariance matrix
</p>
<p>'vad': threshold the error covariance matrix directly.
</p>
<p>Default value is set at matrix='cor'.
</p>
</td></tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function is for POET, proposed by Fan, Liao and Mincheva (2012)
&quot;Large Covariance Estimation by Thresholding Principal Orthogonal Complements&quot;,
manuscript of Princeton  University
</p>
<p>Model:  Y_t=Bf_t+u_t, where B, f_t and u_t represent factor loading
matrix, common factors and idiosyncratic error respectively.
Only Y_t is observable. t=1,...,n. Dimension of Y_t is p. The
goal is to estimate the covariance matrices of Y_t and u_t.
</p>
<p>Note: 
(1) POET is optimization-free, so no initial value, tolerant, or
maximum iterations need to be specified as inputs.
</p>
<p>(2) We can apply the adaptive thresholding (Cai and Liu 2011, JASA) on either the
correlation matrix or the covariance matrix, specified by the option 'matrix'.
</p>
<p>(3) If no factor structure is assumed, i.e., no common factors
exist and var(Y_t) itself is sparse, set K=0.
</p>

<h2 id='POETKhat'>Khat - number of factors in approximate factor model

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function is for calculating the optimal number of factors
in an approximate factor model.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>POETKhat(Y)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table role = "presentation">

</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p> This method was proposed by Bai &amp; Ng (2002) and Hallin &amp; Liska (2007).
They propose two penalty functions and in turn minimize the corresponding
information criteria. Notice that this method may underestimate K. POET is very robust to over-estimating K. But under-estimating K
can result to VERY BAD performance. Therefore we strongly recommend
choosing a relatively large K (normally less than 8) to avoid
missing any important common factor.
