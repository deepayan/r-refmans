<h2 id='binMS'>Consolidate mass spectrometry observations</h2><span id='topic+binMS'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Combines mass spectrometry observations that are believed to belong to the
same underlying compound into a single observation.  In concept, the data
produced by the mass spectrometer may produce multiple reads for a single
compound; thus, <code>binMS</code> attempts to recover these underlying compounds
through a binning procedure, described in more detail in <code>Details</code>.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>binMS(mass_spec, mtoz, charge, mass = NULL, time_peak_reten,
  ms_inten = NULL, time_range, mass_range, charge_range, mtoz_diff, time_diff)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr><td><code id="binMS_+3A_mass_spec">mass_spec</code></td>
<td>
<p>Either a <code>matrix</code> or <code>data.frame</code>.  This object
must contain mass spectrometry abundances, and may optionally contain
mass-to-charge values, charge state information, or additional extraneous
variables.  The mass spectrometry data is expected to be in a form with
each column corresponding to a variable and each row corresponding to a
mass-to-charge level.
</p>
<p>For example, suppose that a collection of mass spectrometry intensity
observations has provided data for 50 fractions across 20,000
mass-to-charge values.  Then the input for <code>mass_spec</code> should be a
<code>matrix</code> or <code>data.frame</code> with 20,000 rows and 50 or more
columns.  The additional columns beyond the 50 containing the mass
spectrometry intensities can be the mass-to-charge data, the charge data,
or other extraneous variables (the extraneous variables will be discarded
when constructing the <code>msDat</code> object).</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="binMS_+3A_mtoz">mtoz</code></td>
<td>
<p>A vector of either length 1 or length equal to the number of
mass-to-charge values for which mass spectrometry data was collected, and
which helps identify the mass-to-charge values for this data in one of
several ways.
</p>
<p>One way to provide the information is to provide a numeric vector where
each entry provides the mass-to-charge value for a corresponding row of
mass spectrometry data.  Then the <code>k</code>-th entry of the vector would
provide the mass-to-charge value for the <code>k</code>-th row of the mass
spectrometry data.
</p>
<p>A second way is to provide a single number which specifies the column
index in the <code>matrix</code> or <code>data.frame</code> provided as the argument
for the <code>mass_spec</code> parameter, such that this column contains the
mass-to-charge information.
</p>
<p>A third way is provide a single character string which provides the
column name in the <code>matrix</code> or <code>data.frame</code> provided as the
argument for the <code>mass_spec</code> parameter, such that this column
contains the mass-to-charge information.  Partial matching is supported.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="binMS_+3A_charge">charge</code></td>
<td>
<p>The information for the <code>charge</code> parameter can be provided
in the same manner as for the mass-to-charge values.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="binMS_+3A_mass">mass</code></td>
<td>
<p>The information for the mass need not be provided, as it can be
derived using the mass-to-charge and charge information; in this case the
parameter should be given its default, i.e. <code>NULL</code>.  If however the
information for mass is already included in the dataset in hand, then
providing it to the function will be slightly more efficient then
re-performing the calculations.  The information for the <code>charge</code>
parameter can be provided in the same manner as for the mass-to-charge
values.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="binMS_+3A_time_peak_reten">time_peak_reten</code></td>
<td>
<p>The information for the <code>time_peak_reten</code>
parameter can be provided in the same manner as for the mass-to-charge
and other information; this paramater specifies the time at which the
peak retention level of the compound was achieved.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="binMS_+3A_ms_inten">ms_inten</code></td>
<td>
<p>Either <code>NULL</code> or a vector either of mode character or
mode numeric specifying which of the variables in the argument to
<code>mass_spec</code> are to be retained as the mass spectrometry intensity
data.  If <code>NULL</code>, then it is taken to mean that the entirety of the
data in <code>mass_spec</code>, after removing variables in the data that are
specified as arguments, is the mass spectrometry intensity data.  If it
is a numeric vector, then the entries should provide the indices for the
region of interest in the mass spectrometry data in the argument for
<code>msObj</code>. If it is a character vector, then the entries should
uniquely specify the region of interest through partial string matching.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="binMS_+3A_time_range">time_range</code></td>
<td>
<p>A length-2 numeric vector specifying the lower bound and
upper bound (inclusive) of allowed peak retention time occurance for an
observation to be included in the consolidation process.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="binMS_+3A_mass_range">mass_range</code></td>
<td>
<p>A length-2 numeric vector specifying the lower bound and
upper bound (inclusive) of allowed mass for an observation to be included
in the consolidation process.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="binMS_+3A_charge_range">charge_range</code></td>
<td>
<p>A length-2 numeric vector specifying the lower bound and
upper bound (inclusive) of allowed electrical charge state for an
observation to be included in the consolidation process.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="binMS_+3A_mtoz_diff">mtoz_diff</code></td>
<td>
<p>A single numerical value such that any two observations with
a larger absolute difference between their mass-to-charge values are
considered to have originated from different underlying compounds.  Two
observations with a smaller absolute difference between their
mass-to-charge values could potentially be considered to originate from
the same underlying compound, contingent on other criteria also being
met.  Nonnegative values are allowed; such a value has the effect of not
consolidating any groups, and consequently reduces the function to a
filtering routine only.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="binMS_+3A_time_diff">time_diff</code></td>
<td>
<p>A single numerical value such that any two observations with
a larger absolute difference between their peak elution times are
considered to have originated from different underlying compounds.  Two

underlying compound, contingent on other criteria also being met.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The algorithm described in what follows attempts to combines mass
spectrometry observations that are believed to belong to the same
underlying compound into a single observation for each compound.  There
are two conceptually separate steps.
</p>
<p>The first step is as follows.  All observations must satisfy each of the
following criteria for inclusion in the binning process.
</p>

<ol>
<li><p> Each observation must have its peak elution time occur during the
interval specified by <code>time_range</code>
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Each observation must have a mass that falls within the interval
specified by <code>mass_range</code>
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Each observation must have an electrical charge state that falls
within the interval specified by <code>charge_range</code>
</p>
</li></ol>

<p>Once that a set of observations satisfying the above criteria is
obtained, then a second step attempts to combine observations believed to
belong to the same underlying compound.  The algorithm considers two
observations that satisfy each of the following criteria to belong to the
same compound.
</p>

<ol>
<li><p> The absolute difference in Daltons of the mass-to-charge value
between the two observations is less the the value specified by
<code>mtoz_diff</code>
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The absolute difference of the peak elution time between the two
observations is less than the value specified by <code>time_pr_diff</code>
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The electrical charge state must be the same for the two observations
</p>
</li></ol>

<p>Then the binning algorithm is defined as follows.  Consider an
observation that satisfies the inclusion criteria; this observation is
compaired pairwise with every other observation that satisfies the
inclusion criteria.  If a pair of observations satisfies the criteria
determining them to belong to the same underlying compound then the two
observations are merged into a single observation.  The two previous
compounds are removed from the working set, and the process starts over
with the newly created observation.  The process repeats until no other
observation in the working set meets the criteria determining it to
belong to the same underlying compound as that of the current
observation; at this point it is considered that all observations
belonging to the compound have been found, and the process starts over
with a new observation.
</p>
<p>The merging process has not yet been defined; it is performed by
averaging the mass-to-charge values and peak elution times, and summing
the mass spectrometry intensities at each fraction.  Although
observations are merged pairwise, when multiple observations are combined
in a sequence of pairings, the averages are given equal weight for all of
the observations.  In other words, if a pair of observations are merged,
and then a third observation is merged with the new observation created
by combining the original two, then the mass-to-charge value and peak
elution time values of the new observation are obtained by summing the
values for each of the three original observations and dividing by three.
The merging process for more than three observations is conducted
similarly.
</p>
<p>Having described the binning algorithm, it is apparent that there are
scenarios in which the order in which observations are merged affects the
outcome of the algorithm.  Since it seems that a minumum requirement of
any binning algorithm is that the algorithm is invariant to the ordering
of the observations in the data, this algorithm abides by the following
rules.  The observations in the data are sorted in increasing order by
mass-to-charge value, peak elution time, and electical charge state,
respectively.  Then when choosing an observation to compare to the rest
of the set, we start with the observation at the top of the sort
ordering, and compare it one-at-a-time to the other elements in the set
according to the same ordering.  When a consolidated observation is
complete in that no other observation left in the working set satisfies
the merging criteria, then this consolidated observation can be removed
from consideration for all future merges.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Attempts to filter out candidate compounds via subject-matter
knowledge, with the goal of removing spurious noise from downstream
models.  The criteria for the downstream inclusion of a candidate
compound is listed below.
</p>

<ol>
<li><p> The m/z intensity maximum must fall inside the range of the
bioactivity region of interest
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The ratio of the m/z intensity of a species in the areas bordering
the region of interest and the species maximum intensity must be less
than <code>bord_ratio</code>.  When there is no bordering area then it is
taken to mean that all observations satisfy this criterion.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The immediately right adjacent fraction to its maximum intensity
fraction for a species must have a non-zero abundance.  In the case
of ties for the maximum, it is the fraction immediately to the right
of the rightmost maximum fraction which cannot have zero abundance.
When the fraction with maximum intensity is the rightmost fraction in
the data for an observation, then it is taken to mean that the
observation satisfies this criterion.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> At least 1 fraction in the region of interest must have intensity
greater than <code>min_inten</code>
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Compound charge state must be less than or equal to <code>max_chg</code>

<h2 id='msDat'>Constructor for class <code>msDat</code></h2><span id='topic+msDat'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Creates a data structure encapsulating the mass spectrometry intensity
readings as well as identifying information
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>msDat(mass_spec, mtoz, charge, ms_inten = NULL)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr><td><code id="msDat_+3A_mass_spec">mass_spec</code></td>
<td>
<p>Either a <code>matrix</code> or <code>data.frame</code>.  This object
must contain mass spectrometry abundances, and may optionally contain
mass-to-charge values, charge state information, or additional extraneous
variables.  The mass spectrometry data is expected to be in a form with
each column corresponding to a variable and each row corresponding to a
mass-to-charge level.
</p>
<p>For example, suppose that a collection of mass spectrometry intensity
observations has provided data for 50 fractions across 20,000
mass-to-charge values.  Then the input for <code>mass_spec</code> should be a
<code>matrix</code> or <code>data.frame</code> with 20,000 rows and 50 or more
columns.  The additional columns beyond the 50 containing the mass
spectrometry intensities can be the mass-to-charge data, the charge data,
or other extraneous variables (the extraneous variables will be discarded
when constructing the <code>msDat</code> object).</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="msDat_+3A_mtoz">mtoz</code></td>
<td>
<p>A vector of either length 1 or length equal to the number of
mass-to-charge values for which mass spectrometry data was collected, and
which helps identify the mass-to-charge values for this data in one of
several ways.
</p>
<p>One way to provide the information is to provide a numeric vector where
each entry provides the mass-to-charge value for a corresponding row of
mass spectrometry data.  Then the <code>k</code>-th entry of the vector would
provide the mass-to-charge value for the <code>k</code>-th row of the mass
spectrometry data.
</p>
<p>A second way is to provide a single number which specifies the column
index in the <code>matrix</code> or <code>data.frame</code> provided as the argument
for the <code>mass_spec</code> parameter, such that this column contains the
mass-to-charge information.
</p>
<p>A third way is provide a single character string which provides the
column name in the <code>matrix</code> or <code>data.frame</code> provided as the
argument for the <code>mass_spec</code> parameter, such that this column
contains the mass-to-charge information.  Partial matching is supported.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="msDat_+3A_charge">charge</code></td>
<td>
<p>The information for the <code>charge</code> parameter can be provided
in the same manner as for the mass-to-charge values.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="msDat_+3A_ms_inten">ms_inten</code></td>
<td>
<p>Either <code>NULL</code> or a vector either of mode character or
mode numeric specifying which of the variables in the argument to
<code>mass_spec</code> are to be retained as the mass spectrometry intensity
data.  If <code>NULL</code>, then it is taken to mean that the entirety of the
data in <code>mass_spec</code>, after removing variables in the data that are
specified as arguments, is the mass spectrometry intensity data.  If it
is a numeric vector, then the entries should provide the indices for the
region of interest in the mass spectrometry data in the argument for
<code>msObj</code>. If it is a character vector, then the entries should
uniquely specify the region of interest through partial string matching.</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Since the mass spectrometry data could conceivably be available to
the researcher in a variety forms, this function attempts to provide a
uniform data structure for encapsulating this information.  It is the
fundamental data structure containing the mass spectrometry data used
internally by the <code>filterMS</code> and <code>rankEN</code> routines.  The
external interface for <code>msDat</code> is provided to the user so that
specifying the mass spectrometry information can be made in a distinct
step from performing statistical analyses, which it is hoped makes
interfaces for the downstream analysis routines simpler and more
intuitive to use.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Returns an object of class <code>msDat</code>.  This class is a <code>list</code>
with elements described below.  The class is equipped with a <code>print</code>
and <code>extractMS</code> function.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>ms</code></dt><dd><p> A <code>matrix</code> containing mass spectrometry intensity
readings. Each column provides the mass spectrometry values for a
given fraction, and each row provides the mass spectrometry values
for a given mass-to-charge ratio value across the fractions. </p>
</dd>
<dt><code>mtoz</code></dt><dd><p> A vector with length equal to the number of
mass-to-charge values provided in the mass spectrometry data, such
that the <code>k</code>-th entry in the vector provides the mass-to-charge
value for the <code>k</code>-th row of mass spectrometry data </p>
</dd>
<dt><code>chg</code></dt><dd><p> A vector with length equal to the number of
mass-to-charge values provided in the mass spectrometry data, such

<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>rankEN</code> prepares the data by extracting the region of interest
from the mass spectrometry abundance data and from the bioactivity data.
If bioactivity replicates are present, then the within-fraction
replicates are averaged.  Once the data has been converted into the
appropriate form, then an elastic net model is fitted by invoking the
<code>enet</code> function from the <code>elasticnet</code> package, and an ordered
list of candidate compounds is constructed such that compounds are ranked
by the order in which they first enter the model.  The list may be
filtered and / or pruned before being returned to the user, as determined
by the arguments to <code>pos_only</code> and <code>ncomp</code>.
