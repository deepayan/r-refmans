<td>Open source data allows for reproducible research and helps advance

    people with intravitreal injections with anti-vascular endothelial growth
    factor (anti-VEGF), due to age-related macular degeneration or diabetic

<h3>Study setting and design</h3>

<p>Of 10,744 eyes with neovascular AMD receiving anti-VEGF therapy between
October 2008 and February 2020, 7802 eyes met study criteria
(treatment-naïve, first-treated eyes starting anti-VEGF therapy).
Institution:	 Moorfields Eye Clinic, London, UK
Approval was granted by the Institutional Review Board of the hospital
(ROAD17/031). The study complied with the Declaration of Helsinki
</p>


<h3>Data source</h3>

<p>All clinical information at Moorfields Eye Hospital is recorded within an
electronic medical record (EMR) application (OpenEyes Foundation, London, UK).
A SQL database (SQL Server Reporting Service, Microsoft Corporation, Richmond, USA)
containing all the information from the EMR is in place and regular updates
are performed overnight to keep the data warehouse up-to-date.
VA is reported in ETDRS letter score (and categories for ETDRS &lt; 1).
The highest value (independent of measurement method)
available at each visit was chosen.
</p>


<h3>Data</h3>

which underwent intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy with ranibizumab
and/or aflibercept.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The data was collected in Moorfields Eye Hospital, London, UK.
(Information governance sign off Moorfields Eye Hospital 19/07/2018)
</p>
<p>Data was accessed on the 25th May 2020
</p>


<h3>Missing values</h3>

<p>There are two missing visual acuity entries in this data set. They result
from data entry errors (ETDRS values above 100) in the original
medical health records. Unfortunately, the correct VA value could not be
retrieved and it was decided to assign missing values to those measurements.

<h3>Central retinal thickness (CRT)</h3>

<p>There are double CRT measurements for 1011 time points. This is because the
data set curator provided both automatic measurement and manual measurement.
Unfortunately, based on the information in the raw data, it is not possible
to know which entry belongs to which. One possible way to adjust for this may
be to create an average for both measurements. For one way to do this, see
&quot;Examples&quot;
</p>


<h3>Missing values</h3>

<p>There are 1388 missing visual acuity entries and 858 missing central retinal
thickness entries.
</p>


<h3>Study setting and design</h3>

<p>Retrospective cohort study of treatment-naïve, first-affected eyes with
nAMD started on ranibizumab before January 1, 2009.
Approval was granted by the Institutional Review Board of the hospital
(ROAD17/031). The study complied with the Declaration of Helsinki

<h3>Missing values</h3>

<p>There are 233 missing visual acuity entries in this data set. They result
from data entry errors (ETDRS values above 100) and missing data in the original
medical health records.
</p>


<h3>Study setting and design</h3>

<p>Study setting and design: This study is a retrospective cohort study of
patients that commenced anti-VEGF therapy for neovascular AMD
between June 2012 and June 2017 at Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust,
London, UK.
Approval was granted by the Institutional Review Board of the hospital
(ROAD17/031). The study complied with the Declaration of Helsinki
</p>


<h3>Data source</h3>

<p>All clinical information at Moorfields Eye Hospital is recorded within an
electronic medical record (EMR) application (OpenEyes Foundation, London, UK).
A SQL database (SQL Server Reporting Service, Microsoft Corporation, Richmond, USA)
containing all the information from the EMR is in place and regular updates
are performed overnight to keep the data warehouse up-to-date.
VA is reported in ETDRS letter score (and categories for ETDRS &lt; 1). The highest value (independent of
measurement method) available at each visit was chosen.
</p>


<h3>OCT</h3>

<p>Each voxel equates to 2.60 x 11.72 x 47.24 microns in the A-scan, B-scan, and
C-scan directions, respectively. All OCT data is captured using 3DOCT-2000
devices (Topcon Corp., Tokyo, Japan). All images comprise 512 x 885 x 128 voxels
covering a volume of 6x6x2.3mm. In this dataset, only one image is available
per eye. The image with the lowest segmented artifacts was chosen if multiple
scans were available at the same visit.
</p>


<h3>Time variable</h3>

<p>For first-treated eyes, time will generally equal 0. Where a scan at day 0
was not available, a scan up to 14 days prior to the first
injection (i.e. up to -14 days), is used for analysis.
</p>


<h3>Segmentation</h3>

<p>Segmentation data was output using a deep learning segmentation model described
further in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-018-0107-6">De Fauw et al.</a> and

<h3>Missing values</h3>

<p>There are 18 missing visual acuity entries in this data set. They result

</p>


<h3>Study setting and design</h3>

<p>Study setting and design: This study is a retrospective cohort study of
diabetic patients treated for DMO by anti-VEGF at a tertiary referral center -
Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK.
Approval was granted by the Institutional Review Board of the hospital
(ROAD17/031) - Audit registration was completed (MEH-233).
The study complied with the Declaration of Helsinki and STROBE guidelines
for the reporting of cohort studies.
</p>


<h3>Data source</h3>

<p>All clinical information at Moorfields Eye Hospital is recorded within an
electronic medical record (EMR) application (OpenEyes Foundation, London, UK).
A SQL database (SQL Server Reporting Service, Microsoft Corporation, Richmond, USA)
containing all the information from the EMR is in place and regular updates

VA is reported in ETDRS letter score. The highest value (independent of

</p>


<h3>Participants</h3>

<p>A data-warehouse query for patients that received one IVI for DMO
(between March 2013 and October 2018) resulted in 3226 unique eyes from
2368 patients. Exclusion criteria were those that:
