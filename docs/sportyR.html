hit the ball</a></li>
<li><a href='#baseball_catchers_box'><p>The catcher's box. This is where the catcher is located on defense, usually</p>
marked by two white lines and a back line as well. The box may take various
shapes, which are controlled by the <code>catchers_box_shape</code> parameter</a></li>
<li><a href='#baseball_features_set_colors'><p>Set the colors to be used for the plot. The values provided in the arguments</p>
are the defaults, and, where specified, are the rule-book specified values.</a></li>
<li><a href='#baseball_foul_line'><p>The foul line. These are the white lines that extend from the back tip of</p>
home plate (but not visibly through the batter's boxes) out to the fair/foul
pole in the outfield. Since a ball on the line is considered in fair
territory, the outer edge of the baseline must lie in fair territory (aka the
line y = +/- x)</a></li>
<li><a href='#baseball_home_plate'><p>Home plate. This is a pentagonal shape with its back tip located at the</p>
origin of the coordinate system. The angled sides of home plate intersect the
baselines</a></li>

the court coloring inside of the inner edge of this circle</a></li>
<li><a href='#basketball_center_circle_outline'><p>The center circle is broken into two parts: the outline (this feature) and</p>
the fill, which is the court coloring inside of the inner edge of this circle</a></li>
<li><a href='#basketball_court_apron'><p>The apron of the court is the colored boundary around the exterior of some</p>
courts. If no such colored boundary exists, this should take the same color
as the court floor</a></li>
<li><a href='#basketball_division_line'><p>The division line divides the court into two halves, and is sometimes</p>
referred to as the time line or half-court line. The center of this line goes
through the y axis, with half of the line lying in a team's offensive half
court and the other half in their defensive half court</a></li>
<li><a href='#basketball_endline'><p>The endline on a basketball court, also called the baseline, is located</p>
beyond each basket. In cases where the endline is the court apron, the
endline should still be generated and its color should be set equal to the
court apron's color (see <code>basketball_court_apron()</code> for more information on
the court apron)</a></li>
<li><a href='#basketball_features_set_colors'><p>Set the colors to be used for the plot. The values provided in the arguments</p>
are the defaults, and, where specified, are the rule-book specified values.</a></li>

via <code>basketball_free_throw_circle_fill()</code></a></li>
<li><a href='#basketball_free_throw_circle_dash'><p>On some courts, there are a series of dashes that comprise the bottom half of</p>
the free throw circle (e.g. the half closer to the basket). This function
generates a single dash</a></li>
<li><a href='#basketball_free_throw_circle_fill'><p>The filled-in section of the free throw circle. The circle is the area where</p>

the division line, and serves as the base layer of the court plot</a></li>
<li><a href='#basketball_inbounding_line'><p>The inbounding line is where the ball is inbounded on the sideline when</p>
necessary. Lines drawn on the top of the court should be drawn in a top-down
direction, and lines on the bottom of the court should be drawn in the
bottom-up direction</a></li>
<li><a href='#basketball_lane_space_mark'><p>The lane space marks, also known as the blocks, denote where non-shooting</p>
players stand during free throws. Players may not cross these lines before
the ball touches the rim on the shot attempt</a></li>
<li><a href='#basketball_lower_defensive_box_mark'><p>The lower defensive box is an imaginary box on the court extending from the</p>
lines on the baseline to the lines inside the painted area. This box helps
determine when a block/charge call should take place, as an offensive player
is entitled to move outside of (and subsequently enter) this box without
contact</a></li>

interior radius should be specified for this feature.</a></li>
<li><a href='#basketball_sideline'><p>The sideline on a basketball court run the full length of the court,</p>
typically with the team bench areas and substitution areas on their exterior.
In cases where the sideline is the court apron, the sideline should still be
generated and its color should be set equal to the court apron's color (see
<code>basketball_court_apron()</code> for more information on the court apron)</a></li>
<li><a href='#basketball_substitution_line'><p>The substitution line is where players checking into the game wait for a</p>
stoppage. Lines drawn on the top of the court should be drawn in a top-down
direction, and lines on the bottom of the court should be drawn in the
bottom-up direction</a></li>
<li><a href='#basketball_team_bench_line'><p>Players not in the game must stay within the team bench lines unless moving</p>
to the substitution area (see <code>basketball_substitution_line()</code> class)</a></li>
<li><a href='#basketball_three_point_line'><p>An arc on the court, behind which any made basket counts as three points and</p>
in front of which, any made basket will count as two points (see
<code>basketball_two_point_range()</code> for more information).</a></li>
<li><a href='#basketball_two_point_range'><p>If a court has a three-point line (see <code>basketball_three_point_line()</code>), then</p>
any made basket (not including free throws) made from inside of the arc are
worth two points. The area inside of this arc is therefore referred to as two
point range, which this feature draws. This feature is enclosed by the
three-point line's outer edge and the baseline's inner edge</a></li>

used as its anchor point</a></li>
<li><a href='#curling_button'><p>The inner-most of the concentric circles comprising the house is called the</p>
button. This is the intersection of the tee line (see <code>curling_tee_line()</code>)
and the centre line (see <code>curling_centre_line()</code>)</a></li>
<li><a href='#curling_centre_line'><p>The centre line is the line that runs the full length of the curling sheet,</p>
or the line <code>x = 0</code> in TV view</a></li>
<li><a href='#curling_centre_zone'><p>The curling sheet is the entire sheet, with the houses at either the top or</p>
bottom ends. This draws the area between the hog lines</a></li>
<li><a href='#curling_courtesy_line'><p>The courtesy lines are where players stand during the delivery process of</p>
each stone when the opposing team is throwing</a></li>

are the defaults, and, where specified, are the rule-book specified values.</a></li>
<li><a href='#curling_hack_foothold'><p>The hack exits on both sides of the curling sheet between the back board and</p>
the back line. This is where a curler pushes off from, and it should be
centered on the centre line (see <code>curling_centre_line()</code>). This function
draws one of the footholds of the hack</a></li>
<li><a href='#curling_hack_line'><p>The hack line connects the two footholds at each hack. It should be anchored</p>
at the terminus of the centre line (see <code>curling_centre_line()</code> for more
information)</a></li>
<li><a href='#curling_hog_line'><p>The hog line is the line that begins the Free Guard Zone at each end of the</p>
ice. Its inner edge (relative to the nearest house) should be used as its
anchor point</a></li>

varying radii. This feature is designed to be each of the house rings
excluding the button</a></li>
<li><a href='#curling_sheet_apron'><p>The apron of the sheet is what separates adjacent sheets, and in this context</p>
provides a border around the outside of the sheet</a></li>
<li><a href='#curling_tee_line'><p>The tee line is the line that runs through the center of the house. Its</p>
midpoints are connected by the centre line (see <code>curling_centre_line()</code> for

substitutions occur. This feature describes its outline; its interior fill
is controlled by <code>lacrosse_change_area_fill()</code></a></li>
<li><a href='#lacrosse_defensive_area_line'><p>The defensive-area lines run parallel to the sidelines and are connected to</p>
the end line (see <code>lacrosse_end_line()</code>) and restraining line (see
<code>lacrosse_restraining_line()</code>) when these features are present</a></li>

goal circle (see <code>lacrosse_goal_circle()</code>) that may extend back to the end
line, but also may be cut off at the goal line extended. The extension should
be controlled via the <code>goal_arc_extension</code> parameter. Note: the hash
marks are generated via <code>lacrosse_goal_fan_hash_mark()</code></a></li>
<li><a href='#lacrosse_goal_circle'><p>The goal circle is a circular feature on the field that houses the goal line</p>
(see <code>lacrosse_goal_line()</code>) and the goal. Notably, for fields with a
surrounding arc and/or fan around the goal area, this feature <em>only</em>
circumscribes the goal. Those features will be handled separately. This
feature may either be the full circle (e.g. all 360 degrees), or a partial
circle that may be greater than a half-circle</a></li>
<li><a href='#lacrosse_goal_circle_fill'><p>This feature is the area enclosed by the goal circle's outline. Please see</p>
<code>lacrosse_goal_circle()</code> for more information</a></li>
<li><a href='#lacrosse_goal_fan'><p>The goal arc fan is present on some fields (e.g. NCAAW) as a quarter-circle</p>
located around the goal. The anchor for this feature should be given as the
center of the goal line, but the radius of the arc actually corresponds to
a point on the goal circle (see <code>lacrosse_goal_circle()</code>) that runs through
<code>y = 0</code></a></li>
<li><a href='#lacrosse_goal_fan_hash_mark'><p>The hash marks around the goal fan (see <code>lacrosse_goal_fan()</code>) are drawn</p>
independently from the goal fan itself. These should just be rectangles with
anchor points along the circle</a></li>

should be its center (e.g. half of the line's width should be on each side of
the <code>x</code> anchor)</a></li>
<li><a href='#lacrosse_goal_mouth'><p>The goal mouth is similar to the goal fan, except it is plainly a semi-circle</p>
located in front of the goal on fields for which it appears. The separation
between the ends of it typically correspond to the diameter of the goal
circle</a></li>
<li><a href='#lacrosse_goal_mouth_hash_mark'><p>The goal mouth may have a hash mark that extends towards midfield from the</p>
goal line extended. This is that hash mark, and should be anchored using its

opposite the team bench areas</a></li>
<li><a href='#lacrosse_offensive_zone'><p>The offensive zone is where a team tries to score a goal. It is the TV-right</p>
area on the field</a></li>
<li><a href='#lacrosse_penalty_box_fill'><p>The penalty boxes are the areas outside the confines of the field where</p>
players serve time for a penalty incurred. They are to be on the same side of
the field surface and separate, as close to center field as possible, for
each team. This will not include the off-field officials' box; see
<code>lacrosse_off_field_officials_box()</code> for more information</a></li>
<li><a href='#lacrosse_penalty_box_outline'><p>The penalty boxes are the areas outside the confines of the field where</p>
players serve time for a penalty incurred. They are to be on the same side of

(either more towards the goal or more towards the halfway line) during corner
kicks</a></li>
<li><a href='#soccer_features_set_colors'><p>Set the colors to be used for the plot. The values provided in the arguments</p>
are the defaults, and, where specified, are the rule-book specified values.</a></li>

the same thickness as the goal line, and the posts must rest on the front
edge of the goal line</a></li>
<li><a href='#soccer_goal_box'><p>The goal box is the smaller of the two boxes that extend from the goal line</p>
The goal box is usually 5.5 meters (6 yards) from the goal line, but may be
parameterized via this function</a></li>
<li><a href='#soccer_goal_line'><p>The goal line is the line that runs the full width of the pitch. The ball</p>
must completely cross the goal line to score a goal for the attacking team</a></li>
<li><a href='#soccer_half_pitch'><p>Half of the pitch is located on each side of the halfway line (see</p>
<code>soccer_halfway_line()</code> for more information)</a></li>
<li><a href='#soccer_halfway_line'><p>The halfway line, aka the midfield line or center line, runs the width of the</p>

the entire width of the court, and its back edge denotes the furthest
boundary inside of which a ball can land and be considered in play</a></li>
<li><a href='#tennis_center_mark'><p>The center mark identifies the center point of the</p>
<code>tennis_baseline()</code>. The line should extend towards the net</a></li>
<li><a href='#tennis_center_serviceline'><p>The center serviceline on the court divides the service area into two parts:</p>
the ad court (left) and the deuce court (right)</a></li>
<li><a href='#tennis_court_apron'><p>The court apron is referred to as the backstop and sidestop. These areas are</p>
entirely outside of the playing court, but legal shots made here are
considered in play</a></li>
<li><a href='#tennis_doubles_alley'><p>The doubles alley is the area between the singles and doubles sideline. It</p>
should run the entire length of the court</a></li>
<li><a href='#tennis_features_set_colors'><p>Set the colors to be used for the plot. The values provided in the arguments</p>
are the defaults, and, where specified, are the rule-book specified values.</a></li>
<li><a href='#tennis_frontcourt_half'><p>The front court is the area between the <code>tennis_net()</code> and the</p>
<code>tennis_serviceline()</code>. left-hand side of the court when facing the net from
the nearest baseline is the ad court, and the right-hand side is the deuce
court. This is constrained by the singles <code>tennis_sideline()</code>.</a></li>
<li><a href='#tennis_net'><p>The net divides the court into two halves, and should run through the line</p>
<code>x = 0</code> when viewing the court in TV view</a></li>
<li><a href='#tennis_serviceline'><p>The serviceline is the line in front of which (nearest the net) a serve must</p>
land, and be on the proper side of the court to be considered legal and in
play</a></li>
<li><a href='#tennis_sideline'><p>The sideline runs the entire length of the court, and there may be up to four</p>
sidelines on the court (this may refer to either the singles or doubles
sideline). Lines are considered in play, so the outer edge of the sideline
will lie along <code>x = court_width / 2</code></a></li>
<li><a href='#volleyball_attack_line'><p>The attack line runs from sideline to sideline separating the court's</p>
backcourt (<code>volleyball_backcourt()</code>) from the front zone
(<code>volleyball_front_zone()</code>). Players in the front row may attack from either
side of this line, while players in the back row must begin their attack from
the backcourt side of the line. The anchor point of this feature should be
its outer edge</a></li>
<li><a href='#volleyball_backcourt'><p>The backcourt is the area between the the attack line (see</p>
<code>volleyball_attack_line()</code>) and the end line (see <code>volleyball_end_line()</code>).
Players playing in the back row of the rotation must take off from this area
before attacking the ball. If considering the entirety of the volleyball

view, dividing the court into two equal halves</a></li>
<li><a href='#volleyball_court_apron'><p>The court apron is similar to the <code>basketball_court_apron()</code> in that it is</p>
the area outside the court. It may be the same color as the interior of the
court, but isn't necessarily. Unlike <code>basketball_court_apron()</code> however, the
boundary line thickness doesn't matter since the lines are considered in-play
and therefore are included in the court's length and width. This is a colored
area inside of the free zone (see <code>volleyball_free_zone()</code>).</a></li>
<li><a href='#volleyball_end_line'><p>The lines on the court that run the full width of the court are referred to</p>
as the end lines, with the full width of the line being considered in bounds</a></li>

are the defaults, and, where specified, are the rule-book specified values.</a></li>
<li><a href='#volleyball_free_zone'><p>The free zone is similar to the <code>basketball_court_apron()</code> in that it is the</p>
area outside the court. It may be the same color as the interior of the
court, but isn't necessarily. Unlike <code>basketball_court_apron()</code> however, the
boundary line thickness doesn't matter since the lines are considered in-play
and therefore are included in the court's length and width. This is not the
same as the <code>volleyball_court_apron()</code>, as this is the entire area outside of
the court's lines, while the court apron corresponds to a colored apron
inside the free zone</a></li>
<li><a href='#volleyball_front_zone'><p>The front zone is the area between the attack line (see</p>
<code>volleyball_attack_line()</code>) and the line running along <code>x = 0</code>. If
considering the entirety of the volleyball court as being divided into
thirds, this is <em>half</em> of the middle third of the court</a></li>
<li><a href='#volleyball_service_zone_mark'><p>The service zone marks are the lines beyond the end lines that denote where a</p>
legal serve must take place. These appear as four hash marks that are out of
bounds of the court, but contained within the free zone (see
<code>volleyball_free_zone()</code> for reference)</a></li>
<li><a href='#volleyball_sideline'><p>The lines on the court that run the full length of the court are referred to</p>
as the sidelines, with the full width of the line being considered in bounds</a></li>
<li><a href='#volleyball_substitution_zone_dash'><p>The substitution zone is typically marked by a dashed line extending from the</p>
attack lines (see <code>volleyball_attack_line()</code> for more). This creates a single
dash, and the dashes should be added to the plot accordingly</a></li>
