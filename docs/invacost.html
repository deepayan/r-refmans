</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>initial_year</code>: first year in the data
</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>final_year</code>: last year in the data

</li></ul>



<h3>Note</h3>

<p>Arguments <code>min.year</code> and <code>max.year</code> do not filter the data. Only 
specify them if you wish to change the interval over which averages are 
calculated. For example, if your data have values from 1960 to 1964 but you
want to calculated the average value from 1960 to 1969, set 
<code>min.year = 1960</code> and <code>max.year = 1969</code>.
</p>
<p>However, if you want to calculate values for an interval narrower than your
data, filter the data BEFORE running this function.

<h3>Description</h3>

<h3>Arguments</h3>

<tr><td><code id="expandYearlyCosts_+3A_costdb">costdb</code></td>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A <code>data.frame</code> containing the 'InvaCost' database where 
all costs occurring over several years are repeated for each year.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>Information on the beginning and ending years was not directly provided in
literature sources of economic costs for a substantial part of entries in the 
database (<code>Probable_starting_year</code> and <code>Probable_ending_year 
columns</code>). 
Therefore, for papers for which this information was not available,  
educated guesses were made by the 'InvaCost' team on the probable starting 
and ending years. These educated guesses were designed 
to be conservative, and make no assumption as of whether the economic impacts 
have been continued after the publication year of the material where the cost
was collected.
Therefore, we used the publication year as the probable ending year. For 
costs repeated over several years but for which no information with respect 
to the exact periods of impact was available, we counted only a single year.
These educated guesses are included in the columns (columns 
<code>Probable_starting_year_adjusted</code> and 
<code>Probable_ending_year_adjusted</code>), and we recommend using them the base 
scenario, as its conservative assumptions limit over-estimations of the 
costs.

<dt>urbanArea</dt><dd><p>Assessment of the geographical area where the cost occurred as being strictly urban if the cost occurred in an urban area only; other if the cost occurred in a non-urban area or in a large area where urban and non-urban areas cannot be distinguished; both if the study compares the cost between urban and non-urban areas (i.e. urban vs. suburban, or suburban vs. non-urban; the comparison must be explicit) or presents the cost across contrasted areas regarding their level of urbanization (e.g. urbanization gradient). Note that we consider the urban nature of study sites purely based on an 'habitat' perspective (i.e. city versus rural areas) rather than a demographic one (e.g. population size or human density)</p>
</dd>
<dt>protectedArea</dt><dd><p>Assessment of the geographical area where the cost occurred as a protected area (Y) or not (N); NA is used if the area comprises both protected and unprotected areas, or if the protection status of the place is unknown</p>
</dd>
<dt>Island</dt><dd><p>Assessment of the geographical area where the cost occurred as an island (Y) or not (N); NA is used when the cost information is not clearly provided, unknown, or comprises both island and mainland together</p>
</dd>
<dt>Geographic_region</dt><dd><p>Geographical region(s) where the cost occurred (Africa, Antarctic-Subantarctic, Asia, Central America, Europe, North America, Oceania, Pacific islands, South America); Diverse/unspecified was used when the cost estimate occurred over several regions simultaneously</p>
</dd>
<dt>Official_country</dt><dd><p>Country where the cost occurred; sometimes, this is not congruent with the geographic region as some territories (e.g., overseas areas) are located in another continent than their official country of attachment; we used information from www.naturalearthdata.com/ as a reference for country's name</p>
</dd>
<dt>State|Province|Administrative_area</dt><dd><p>The second level of geographic division (state, province or territorial administrative area) for the official country where the cost occurred</p>
</dd>
<dt>Location</dt><dd><p>When provided, the precise location (e.g., city, area) where the cost estimate occurred. Otherwise, we put (i) NA when such information was not provided and the cost entry was provided at a unit or site Spatial scale, or (ii) diverse/unspecified when such information was not provided and the cost entry was provided at global, intercontinental, continental, regional or country Spatial scale</p>
</dd>
<dt>Spatial_scale</dt><dd><p>Order of magnitude of the extent, size of the land/water area where the costs incurred. Options include: global (worldwide-scale), intercontinental (areas from two or more geographic regions), continental ('Geographic region' level), regional (several countries within a single 'Geographic region'), country, site (area at intra-country level, including USA states) and unit (well-defined surface area or entity)</p>
</dd>
<dt>Period_of_estimation</dt><dd><p>If provided, the exact period of time covered by the cost, otherwise the raw formulation provided in the reference analyzed (e.g. late 90s, during 5 years)</p>
</dd>
<dt>Time_range</dt><dd><p>Two options: period if the cost is given for a period exceeding a year; or year if the cost is given yearly or for a period up to one year. Alternatively, we put Unspecified if no information is given or guessable from the source</p>
</dd>
<dt>Probable_starting_year</dt><dd><p>Year in which the cost is known or assumed to have started to occurred. When not explicitly provided by the authors, we mentioned unspecified; in the case of a cost estimate provided for a one-year period straddling two calendar years, we mentioned the latest year of the cost occurrence.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Probable_ending_year</dt><dd><p>Year in which the cost is known or assumed to have ended. When not explicitly provided by the authors, we mentioned unspecified; in the case of a cost estimate provided for a one-year period straddling two calendar years, we mentioned the latest year of the cost occurrence.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Probable_starting_year_adjusted</dt><dd><p>Probable starting year and Probable ending year columns where the cells with unspecified information are replaced, as much as possible, by a specific year from educated guesses based on the duration time provided in the original reference (see Period of estimation column).

<h3>Note</h3>

<p>Error bands represent 95
regression, GAM and quantile regression. We cannot construct confidence 
intervals around the mean for MARS techniques. However, we can estimate
prediction intervals by fitting a variance model to MARS residuals. Hence,
the error bands for MARS model represent 95
by fitting a linear model to the residuals of the MARS model. To learn more
about this, see <code><a href="earth.html#topic+varmod">varmod</a></code>
</p>
<p>If the legend appears empty (no colours) on your computer screen, try to
zoom in the plot, or to write to a file. There is a rare bug where under
certain conditions you cannot see the colours in the legend, because of their
transparency; zooming in or writing to a file are the best workarounds.

<h2 id='plot.invacost.costsummary'>Plot raw cumulated cost of invasive species over different periods of time</h2><span id='topic+plot.invacost.costsummary'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function provides different plotting methods for the raw average annual 
cost of invasive species over different periods of time
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>## S3 method for class 'invacost.costsummary'
plot(
  x,
  plot.breaks = 10^(-15:15),
  plot.type = "points",
  average.annual.values = TRUE,
  cost.transf = "log10",
  graphical.parameters = NULL,
  ...
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table role = "presentation">
<tr><td><code id="plot.invacost.costsummary_+3A_x">x</code></td>
<td>
<p>The output object from <code><a href="#topic+summarizeCosts">summarizeCosts</a></code></p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="plot.invacost.costsummary_+3A_plot.breaks">plot.breaks</code></td>
<td>
<p>a vector of numeric values indicating the plot breaks 
for the Y axis (cost values)</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="plot.invacost.costsummary_+3A_plot.type">plot.type</code></td>
<td>
<p><code>"points"</code> or <code>"bars"</code>. Defines the type of plot
you want to make; bars are not advised in log scale because the base value (0)
is infinite in log-scale.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="plot.invacost.costsummary_+3A_average.annual.values">average.annual.values</code></td>
<td>
<p>if <code>TRUE</code>, the plot will represent average
annual values rather than cumulative values over the entire period</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="plot.invacost.costsummary_+3A_cost.transf">cost.transf</code></td>
<td>
<p>Type of transformation you want to apply on cost values.
Specify <code>NULL</code> to avoid any transformation. Only useful
for graphical representation.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="plot.invacost.costsummary_+3A_graphical.parameters">graphical.parameters</code></td>
<td>
<p>set this to <code>"manual"</code> if you want to 
customise <code>ggplot2</code> parameters. 
By default, the following layers are configured: <code>ylab</code>, <code>xlab</code>, 
<code>scale_x_continuous</code>,
<code>theme_bw</code> and, if <code>cost.transf = "log10"</code>, <code>scale_y_log10</code> and 
<code>annotation_logticks</code>. If you specify <code>grahical.parameters = "manual"</code>,
all defaults will be ignored.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function summarizes the cumulative costs and average annual costs of
invasive alien species and breaks it down into regular periods of time, on 
the basis

</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table role = "presentation">
<tr><td><code id="summarizeCosts_+3A_costdb">costdb</code></td>
<td>
<p>The <b>expanded 'InvaCost' database</b> output from 
<code><a href="#topic+expandYearlyCosts">expandYearlyCosts</a></code>,

</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Missing data are ignored. However, note that the average for each 
interval is always calculated on the basis of the full temporal range.
For example, if there is only data for 1968 for the 1960-1969 interval,
then the total cost for the interval will be equal to the cost of 1968, and the
average annual cost for 1960-1969 will be the cost of 1968 / 10.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A <code>list</code> with 6 elements:
</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>cost.data</code>: the input data
</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>parameters</code>: parameters used to run the function. The 
<code>minimum.year</code> and <code>maximum.year</code> are based on the input data
(i.e., the user may specify <code>minimum.year = 1960</code> but the input data may
only have data starting from 1970, hence the <code>minimum.year</code> will be
1970)
</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>year.breaks</code>: the years used to define year intervals over which costs were calculated.
</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>cost.per.year</code>: the costs of invasions expressed per year, 
as sums of all costs for each year
</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>average.total.cost</code>: the average annual cost of invasive Alien
species calculated
over the entire time period
</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>average.cost.per.period</code>: a data.frame containing the average 
annual cost of invasive alien species calculated over each time interval
</p>
</li></ul>

<p>The structure of this object can be seen using <code>str()</code>.
