<p>Create the test folds for k-fold cross validation. These cross-validation types differ from typical stratified cross-validation as this function also

Censored stratification, &quot;censorstrat&quot;, will put approximately the same number of uncensored observations in each fold but not pay any attention to

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function allows one to train an MTLR model given a dataset containing survival data. mtlr uses the Limited-Memory
Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (L-BFGS-B) approximation method to train feature weights. This training is outsourced to the internal
<a href="stats.html#topic+optim">optim</a> function in R. Currently only a few parameters (namely threshold, maxit,lower, upper) of optim are supported, more will
likely become available in the future.
</p>
<p>Weights are initialized to 0 prior to training. Under default settings, the bias weights
will be trained before considering feature weights. As Yu et al. (2011) specified, the introduction of censored observations creates a non-convex
loss function. To address this, weights are first trained assuming all event times are <em>uncensored</em>. Once these starting weights have
been trained another round of training is performed using the true values of the event indicator (censored/uncensored). However, in the event of
all censored data this has shown to negatively effect the results. If all data is censored (either left, right, or interval2) we suggest setting
train_uncensored = FALSE.
</p>
<p>Yu et al. (2011) actually suggested two regularization parameters, C1 to control the size of the feature weights and C2 to control the smoothness.
In Ping Jin's masters thesis (Using Survival Prediction Techniques to Learn Consumer-Specific Reservation Price Distributions) he showed that C2
is not required for smoothness and C1 will suffice (Appendix A.2) so we do not support the C2 parameter in this implementation.
</p>
<p>If an error occurs from optim it is likely the weights are getting too large. Including fewer time points (or specifying better time points) in
addition to changing the lower/upper bounds of L-BFGS-B may resolve these issues. The most common failure has been that the objective value sees
infinite values due to extremely large feature weights.
</p>
<p><strong>Censored data:</strong> Right, left, and interval censored data are all supported both separately and mixed. The convention to input these types of
data follows the <a href="survival.html#topic+Surv">Surv</a> object format.
Per the Surv documentation, &quot;The [interval2] approach is to think of each observation as a time interval with (-infinity, t) for left censored,
(t, infinity) for right censored, (t,t) for exact and (t1, t2) for an interval. This is the approach used for type = interval2.
Infinite values can be represented either by actual infinity (Inf) or NA.&quot; See the examples below for an example of inputting this type of data.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The log-likelihood loss and concordance are supported for optimizing C1. Here the log-likelihood loss considers censored and uncensored observations differently.
For uncensored observations, we assign a loss of the negative log probability assigned to the interval in which the observation had their event, <em>e.g.</em>
if an observation had a 20
is -log(0.2). We want these probabilities to be large so we would normally want to maximize this value (since logs of probabilities are negative)
but we take the negative and instead minimize the value, thus we want the lowest loss. For censored observations we take the log of the probability
of survival at the time of censoring, <em>e.g.</em> if an observation is censored at time = 42 we take the negative log of the survival probability assigned
to time 42 as the loss.
</p>
<p>For the concordance loss, C1 is chosen to maximize the overall concordance when using the negative median as the &quot;risk&quot; score. This is completed using survConcordance in the survival package.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Performing mtlr_cv will return the following:
</p>

<ul>
<li><p> best_C1: The value of C1 which achieved the best (lowest) loss.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> avg_loss: The averaged value of loss across the five folds for each value of C1 tested.

<h2 id='predict.mtlr'>Predictions for MTLR</h2><span id='topic+predict.mtlr'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Compute survival curves and other fitted values for a model generated by <code><a href="#topic+mtlr">mtlr</a></code>.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>## S3 method for class 'mtlr'
predict(object, newdata, type = c("survivalcurve",
  "prob_times", "prob_event", "mean_time", "median_time"), add_zero = T,
  times = c(), ...)

<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr><td><code id="predict.mtlr_+3A_object">object</code></td>
<td>
<p>an object of class mtlr, generated by the <a href="#topic+mtlr">mtlr</a>.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="predict.mtlr_+3A_newdata">newdata</code></td>
<td>
<p>an optional new dataframe for which to perform predictions using MTLR. If left empty, predictions will
be performed using the dataset used to generate the original mtlr object &ndash; note that any error calculation on these
predictions will be optimistic since this will only be the resubstitution error and not be representative of error on a new test set.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="predict.mtlr_+3A_type">type</code></td>
<td>
<p>the type of prediction desired. Options are the survival curve for the time points selected by mtlr (&quot;survivalcurve&quot;), the
survival curve for given times (&quot;prob_times&quot;), the probability of survival at the observations event time (&quot;prob_event&quot;),
the mean survival time (&quot;mean_time&quot;), and the median survival time (&quot;median_time&quot;).
</p>
<p>For &quot;survivalcurve&quot; and &quot;prob_times&quot;, the first column of the matrix returned will correspond to the time points and all other columns will be
the observations survival probability at those associated time points. The index of a (row) observation in newdata will correspond
to the <em>ith + 1</em> column of the returned matrix.
</p>
<p>If &quot;prob_event&quot; is chosen the response (event time) is required. For both &quot;prob_event&quot; and &quot;prob_times&quot;, if the event time is larger
than all of the time points used to build the mtlr model then the last (lowest) probability is used. For example, if the event time is
100 but the largest time point estimated by the mtlr model was 80 then the survival probability at 100 is equal to the survival
probability at 80, <em>i.e. S(100) = S(80)</em>.
</p>
<p>For &quot;mean_time&quot;, if survival curves do not extend to zero survival
probability a linear extension is added (a linear line from (time = 0,probability = 1) to (time = ?, probability =0)). This is the
same for &quot;median_time&quot; except the line need only extend to survival probability = 0.5.
A mean/median survival time of Inf is returned for survival curves with all survival probabilities of 1.</p>

<td>
<p>if TRUE, a time point of &quot;0&quot; and a survival probability of &quot;1&quot; will be added to all survival curves. Additionally,
if add_zero is TRUE, type = &quot;mean_time&quot; will represent the average survival time overall but if FALSE, then &quot;mean_time&quot; will be reduced
by roughly the value of the first time point. However, &quot;median_time&quot; and &quot;prob_event&quot; will be unchanged.</p>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The desired prediction type (a matrix or vector of predictions).
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>The predictions generated by type = &quot;survivalcurve&quot; can be plotted using <code><a href="#topic+plotcurves">plotcurves</a></code> &ndash; packages
ggplot2 and reshape2  must be installed to use this function.
