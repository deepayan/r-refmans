<td>Description:</td>
<td>The single largest source of dams in the United States is the
    National Inventory of Dams (NID) <a href="http://nid.usace.army.mil">http://nid.usace.army.mil</a> from the US
    Army Corps of Engineers. Entire data from the NID cannot be obtained all at
    once and NID's website limits extraction of more than a couple of thousand
    records at a time. Moreover, selected data from the NID's user interface
    cannot not be saved to a file. In order to make the analysis of this data
    easier, all the data from NID was extracted manually. Subsequently, the raw
    data was checked for potential errors and cleaned. This package provides
    sample cleaned data from the NID and provides functionality to access the
    entire cleaned NID data.</td>

 <td style="text-align: left;">
nidid                 </td><td style="text-align: left;"> NID ID (Alphanumeric) The official NID identification number for the dam, known formerly as the National ID. This is a required field, and must have an entry for each dam included in the NID. This field is used as the unique identifier for each dam record. The first two characters of the identity are the state two-letter abbreviation, based on the location of the dam. Typically, the last five characters of the identity are a unique number (AB#####); although States are allowed to use alphanumeric combinations in these last five characters. For saddle dams or dikes, the NID ID is the same as the main dam.

river                 </td><td style="text-align: left;"> River or Stream (Alphanumeric) The River or Stream designation may be entered in one of two ways. For the convenience of some organizations, an alternative field entry is provided which is consistent with the “tributary and offstream” designations used in the 1995-96 NID. If the alternative form is used, the NID Data Team will convert it to the standard form prior to inclusion in the national inventory. River or Stream Standard Entry: The official name of the river or stream on which the dam is built. If the stream is unnamed, identify it as a tributary to a named river, e.g., Snake-TR. If the dam is located offstream, enter the name of the river or stream plus “-OS”, e.g., Snake-OS. River or Stream Alternative Entry: The official name of the river or stream on which the dam is built. If the stream is unnamed, identify it as a tributary to a named river, e.g., TR- Snake.

hazard                </td><td style="text-align: left;"> Downstream Hazard Potential (Alphanumeric) Code to indicate the potential hazard to the downstream area resulting from failure or mis- operation of the dam or facilities: L for Low; S for Significant; H for High U for Undetermined. Definitions, as accepted by the Interagency Committee on Dam Safety, are as follows: 1. LOW HAZARD POTENTIAL Dams assigned the low hazard potential classification are those where failure or mis- operation results in no probable loss of human life and low economic and/or environmental losses. Losses are principally limited to the owner’s property. 2. SIGNIFICANT HAZARD POTENTIAL Dams assigned the significant hazard potential classification are those dams where failure or mis-operation results in no probable loss of human life but can cause economic loss, environment damage, disruption of lifeline facilities, or impact other concerns. Significant hazard potential classification dams are often located in predominantly rural or agricultural areas but could be located in areas with population and significant infrastructure. 3. HIGH HAZARD POTENTIAL Dams assigned the high hazard potential classification are those where failure or mis- operation will probably cause loss of human life. Hazard Potential Loss of Human Life Economic, Environmental, Lifeline Losses Classification Low None expected Low and generally limited to owner Significant None expected Yes High Probable. One or more Yes (but not necessary for this expected classification) 4. UNDETERMINED HAZARD POTENTIAL Dams for which a downstream hazard potential, as defined in 1-3 above, has not been designated or is not provided. Note that dams with a code “U” will be considered for NID inclusion the same as a dam with low hazard potential. If included in the NID, the undetermined classification will be used in publication.</td>

cong_name             </td><td style="text-align: left;"> Condition Assessment (Alphanumeric) Assessment that best describes the condition of the dam based on available information. Satisfactory; Fair; Poor; Unsatisfactory; Not Rated. Definitions, as accepted by the National Dam Safety Review Board, are as follows: 1. SATISFACTORY No existing or potential dam safety deficiencies are recognized. Acceptable performance is expected under all loading conditions (static, hydrologic, seismic) in accordance with the applicable regulatory criteria or tolerable risk guidelines. 2. FAIR No existing dam safety deficiencies are recognized for normal loading conditions. Rare or extreme hydrologic and/or seismic events may result in a dam safety deficiency. Risk may be in the range to take further action. 3. POOR A dam safety deficiency is recognized for loading conditions which may realistically occur. Remedial action is necessary. POOR may also be used when uncertainties exist as to critical analysis parameters which identify a potential dam safety deficiency. Further investigations and studies are necessary.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     </td>
