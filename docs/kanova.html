Pseudo analysis of variance of K-functions
</h2><span id='topic+kanova'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>One-way and two-way pseudo analysis of variance for replicated
point patterns, grouped by one or two classification factors,
on the basis of the values of a summary function.  This summary
function may be specified by the user.  It is usually one of
the four standard summary functions, most often the K-function,
which is the default.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>    kanova(fmla,data,expo=2,rsteps=128,r=NULL,sumFnNm=NULL,
           warnSFN=TRUE,test=TRUE,bylevel=FALSE,
           permtype=c("stdres","data"),nperm=99,brief=TRUE,verb=TRUE,keepdata=FALSE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table role = "presentation">
<tr><td><code id="kanova_+3A_fmla">fmla</code></td>
<td>
<p>A formula specifying the model to be fitted.
There can be at most two main effect predictors (possibly with
interaction between them).  The left hand side of <code>fmla</code>
may be omitted.  If so, it is taken to be the name of the first
column of <code>data</code>.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="kanova_+3A_data">data</code></td>
<td>
<p>A hyperframe (see
<code><a href="spatstat.geom.html#topic+hyperframe">hyperframe</a>()</code>) containing the data to
be analysed.  If the left hand side of <code>fmla</code> is supplied,
then <code>data</code> must have a column with a name which matches
this left hand side. If no such column exists, an error is thrown.
The response column may be a list of point patterns, or it may be
a list of numeric vectors (all of which must have the same length).
</p>
<p>These numeric vectors are notionally values of a diagnostic
or summary function, applied to point patterns, and then
evaluated at the attribute <code>"r"</code> (see below) of <code>data</code>.
However that the entries in the list need not actually <em>be</em>
summary functions.  They are simply numeric vectors and <em>not</em>
objects of class <code>"fv"</code> as returned by a summary function.
In particular they may be scalars, which allows the <code>kanova()</code>
function to be applied to analysis of variance of scalars.
</p>
<p>Argument <code>data</code> may also have one or two columns with names
matching those of the main effect predictors as specified by
<code>fmla</code>.  If such columns cannot be found, then objects
with these names are sought in the &ldquo;parent frame&rdquo;
(see <code><a href="base.html#topic+parent.frame">parent.frame</a>()</code>.)  If the appropriate objects
still cannot be found, then an error is thrown.  These columns
(or objects) are internally coerced to factors.
</p>
<p>If the response consists of numeric vectors, and if these vectors
are <em>not</em> scalars, then <code>data</code> must have an attribute
<code>"r"</code>  which specifies the &ldquo;argument&rdquo; of the pseudo
summary functions in the list.  This attribute should be a
numeric vector and must be of the same length as the numeric
vectors in the list.  If the response functions are scalars,
then no <code>"r"</code> attribute is needed, and, if present, is ignored.
</p>
<p>Finally, <code>data</code> may have a columns named <code>"wts"</code>
(&ldquo;weights&rdquo;) whose entries are positive scalars.  Notionally
they may be thought of as a power of the numbers of
points in the corresponding point patterns.  If there is no column
named <code>"wts"</code> then the weights are all taken to equal 1.
</p>
<p>If the response column consists of a list of point patterns then
any column named <code>"wts"</code> is ignored, and the weights are
indeed a power of the numbers of points in the
corresponding point patterns.  The impact of using these weights
(when <code>expo</code>, see below, is strictly positive) is to diminish
the influence of quantities corresponding to patterns having few
points, and conversely to emphasise the influence of quantities
corresponding to patterns having many points.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="kanova_+3A_expo">expo</code></td>
<td>
<p>Non-negative numeric scalar.  Ignored unless the
response is a list of point patterns.  Statistics in <code>kanova</code>
are in general calculated using <em>weighted</em> means and in this
context the weights are the counts of points in
the patterns, raised to the power <code>expo</code>.  To use unweighted
means, set <code>expo=0</code>.  If <code>expo</code> is equal to <code>1</code>
then the weights are simply the pattern counts.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="kanova_+3A_rsteps">rsteps</code></td>
<td>
<p>Integer scalar.  Ignored if argument <code>r</code>
(see below) is supplied (i.e. is not <code>NULL</code>), or if the
response consists of a list of numeric vectors (rather than a
list of point patterns). The argument <code>rsteps</code> specifies the
number of (equal) steps between values of the vector <code>r</code> at
which the summary function is evaluated.  The values of <code>r</code>
are equispaced on the interval from 0 to <code>rtop</code>, the latter
being calculated internally.  The value of <code>rtop</code> depends
on the observation windows of the patterns in the response and
on their intensities.  It also depends on the summary function
being used.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="kanova_+3A_r">r</code></td>
<td>
<p>Numeric vector.  Ignored unless the response consists of
a list of point patterns.  Note that if the response consists of
a list of vectors, representing notional diagnostic functions,
then argument <code>data</code> must have an attribute <code>r</code> to
provide the relevant <code>r</code> object.  In this setting an error
is thrown if the required attribute is not present (unless the
response vectors are in fact scalars).
</p>
<p>The argument <code>r</code> specifies the values (distances) at
which the summary/diagnostic function (see below) is evaluated.
Errors may be thrown if the first entry of <code>r</code> is not 0,
or if the values of <code>r</code> are not sufficiently finely spaced.
Generally users should not specify <code>r</code>.  unless they have
a sound understanding of what they are doing.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="kanova_+3A_sumfnnm">sumFnNm</code></td>
<td>
<p>Character string naming the summary/diagnostic
function to be used.  If this is not one of the &ldquo;standard
four&rdquo;, i.e. <code>"Kest"</code>, <code>"Fest"</code>,  <code>"Gest"</code>, or
<code>"Jest"</code>,and if <code>warnSFN</code> (see below) is <code>TRUE</code>,
then a warning is issued.  In this case <b>there may
be problems</b>; the code is not robust in this respect.
If <code>sumFnNm</code> is not specified (left <code>NULL</code>) then it
defaults to <code>"Kest"</code>.  Users should apply summary functions
other than <code>Kest()</code> only if they have a sound understanding
of what they are doing.  See <b>Notes</b>.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="kanova_+3A_warnsfn">warnSFN</code></td>
<td>
<p>Logical scalar.  Should a warning be issued if
<code>sumFnNm</code> is not one of the &ldquo;standard four&rdquo;?
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="kanova_+3A_test">test</code></td>
<td>
<p>Logical scalar.  Should a Monte Carlo test of the
null hypothesis be carried out?
</p>
</td></tr> 
<tr><td><code id="kanova_+3A_bylevel">bylevel</code></td>
<td>
<p>Logical scalar.  Should a test of the model <code>y
  ~ A + B</code> be carried out as <code>b</code> one-variable tests of the
significance of A, within each level of B?  That is, should we
perform <code>b</code> tests of <code>y ~ A, data=sdata[[i]]</code>, <code>i =
  1, ..., b</code> where <code>b</code> is the number of levels of the factor B?
</p>
<p>If <code>bylevel</code> is <code>TRUE</code>, then the object returned by
<code>kanova()</code> is an object of class <code>"multi.kanova"</code>, which is
a list of length <code>b</code>, each entry of which is an object of
class <code>"kanova"</code>.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="kanova_+3A_permtype">permtype</code></td>
<td>
<p>Character string specifying what sort of
permutations should be done to produce the Monte Carlo test
statistics.  Ignored if <code>test</code> is <code>FALSE</code>.
</p>
<p>If <code>permtype</code> is <code>"stdres"</code> then the Monte Carlo data
are formed by permuting the residuals, from the <em>saturated</em>
model, which have been standardised by dividing them by their
(estimated) standard deviations.  After permutation, the residuals
are &ldquo;unstandardised&rdquo; by multiplying them by the appropriate
standard deviation.  They are then added back to the fitted values
from the fitted model.
</p>
<p>If <code>permtype</code> is <code>"data"</code> then the Monte Carlo data
are formed by permuting the original data sets. 
</p>
<p>In the two-way setting, when the test is for the main effect A,
then the data (if <code>permtype</code> is <code>"data"</code>) are permuted
<em>within</em> the levels of B.
</p>
<p>If <code>fmla</code> specifies an  interaction between the main effect
predictors, then <code>permtype</code> cannot be <code>"data"</code> and
<em>must</em> be <code>"stdres"</code>, otherwise an error is thrown.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The formulae used in the <code>fmla</code> argument &ldquo;look like&rdquo;
those used in &ldquo;ordinary&rdquo; analysis of variance, but have a
different interpretation.  The formula <code>y ~ A + B</code> does not
actually fit the additive <code>A + B</code> model.  It effects as test
of the &ldquo;significance&rdquo; of A, allowing for B.  The factor B is
&ldquo;allowed for&rdquo; (if <code>permtype</code> is <code>"data"</code>) by permuting
the data <em>within</em> the levels of B.  If <code>permtype</code>
is <code>"stdres"</code>) the standardised residuals are permuted.
These are residuals from the saturated model, which includes a
B effect.  Likewise <code>y ~ B + A</code> tests for a B effect,
allowing for an A effect, in the same manner.
</p>
<p>In particular <code>y ~ A + B</code> is not equivalent to <code>y ~
  B + A</code> (whereas in &ldquo;ordinary&rdquo; analysis of variance) they
<em>are</em> equivalent).
</p>
<p>The formula <code>y ~ A * B</code> tests the model with interaction
against the additive model, as in ordinary analysis of variance.
The additive model is usually not meaningful in the current
context, so a test for interaction is probably not meaningful
either.  Such a test is included in the code basically for the
sake of completeness, and to allow for the possibility that a
user may encounter a circumstance in which the additive model
actually is meaningful.
</p>
<p>The value of the test statistic is obtained as a sum of numerical
integrals of certain sums of squares.  The integrals are
computed via a rough trapezoid rule and the sums of squares are
&ldquo;standardised&rdquo;.  I.e. they are  divided by the estimated
variance of the quantity being squared.  This procedure is
analogous to the studentisation procedure used by Hahn, 2012. The
quantities that are involved in the sums of squares are formed
from certain &ldquo;fitted values&rdquo; which are weighted means
of the observations.  The variance referred to is formed as a
weighted mean of squares of the residuals, which are of course
equal to the observations minus the fitted values.
</p>
<p>The integration is carried out over the value of <code>r</code>, the
argument of the summary functions that are being analysed.  If the
response consists of numeric vectors of length 1, i.e. of scalars,
then no integration is in fact performed, and the corresponding
(downweighted) sum of squares is returned.  You may, if you like,
think of this as integrating with respect to a measure which has
a point mass of 1 at a conceptual single value of <code>r</code>.
</p>
<p>More detail about the test statistic, the fitted values, the
residuals and the estimated variance, can be found in the vignette
<code>"testStat"</code>.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>If <code>bylevel</code> is <code>TRUE</code> then the object returned is
of class <code>"multi.kanova"</code> which is a list of length equal
to then number of levels of the second predictor in the model.
Each entry in this list is an object of class <code>"kanova"</code>.
If <code>keepdata</code> is <code>TRUE</code> then the object in question
(of class <code>"multi.kanova"</code>) has an
attribute <code>"data"</code>.  This is equal to the <code>data</code>
argument, possibly having been augmented by the value of the second
predictor in the model if this predictor was not found in the
original <code>data</code> and was located in the parent frame.
</p>
<p>Note that the <code>"kanova"</code> components of a <code>"multi.kanova"</code>
object <em>never</em> themselves have a list entry named
<code>"data"</code>, irrespective of the value of <code>keepdata</code>.
If <code>keepdata</code> is <code>TRUE</code>, then the appropriate
<code>data</code> object is returned as an <em>attribute</em> of the
<code>"multi.kanova"</code> object.
</p>
<p>If <code>test</code> is <code>TRUE</code> then the <code>"multi.kanova}"</code>
object returned has an attribute named <code>"oapv"</code>
(&ldquo;overall <code class="reqn">p</code>-value&rdquo;).  This is calculated as <code>1 -
   (1 - pvmin)^b</code> where <code>pvmin</code> is the minimum of the <code>b</code>
<code class="reqn">p</code>-values obtained when each of the levels of the second
predictor is tested individually for an A effect.  Note that
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">F(y) = 1 - (1-y)^b</code>
</p>
<p> is the pdf of the minimum of <code class="reqn">b</code>
independent observations that are uniformly distributed on [0,1].
Alternatively one may think of the expression for <code>oapv</code>
as arising from the Sidak adjustment to the minimum <code class="reqn">p</code>-value
to allow for multiple comparisons.
</p>
<p>If <code>bylevel</code> is <code>FALSE</code> then the object returned is
of class <code>"kanova"</code>, and is described as follows:
</p>
<p>If <code>brief</code> is <code>TRUE</code>, then the object in question is
a list with components:
</p>
<table role = "presentation">
<tr><td><code>Effectname</code></td>
<td>
<p>Character string naming the effect being tested for.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>stat</code></td>
<td>
<p>Numerical scalar equal to the value of the test statistic
calculated from the original data.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>pvalue</code></td>
<td>
<p>The Monte Carlo <code class="reqn">p</code>-value of the test calculated
by comparing <code>stat</code> with test statistics formed from simulated
data, generated by permutation, which satisfy the null hypothesis.</p>
</td></tr>
</table>
<p>If <code>brief</code> is <code>FALSE</code> then the <code>"kanova"</code> object in
question has additional components:
</p>
<table role = "presentation">
<tr><td><code>nperm</code></td>
<td>
<p>The <code>nperm</code> argument.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>permtype</code></td>
<td>
<p>The <code>permtype</code> argument.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>Tstar</code></td>
<td>
<p>The vector of <code>nperm</code> values of the test statistic
calculated from the simulated data sets.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>fmla</code></td>
<td>
<p>The <code>fmla</code> argument.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>sumFnNm</code></td>
<td>
<p>The <code>sumFnNm</code> argument.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>The <code>data</code> argument.  This may possibly have
been augmented by any predictor values which were not found in
the original <code>data</code> and were located in the parent frame.</p>
</td></tr>
</table>
<p>Components <code>pvalue</code>, <code>nperm</code> and <code>Tstar</code> are
present in an object of class <code>"kanova"</code> only if <code>test</code>
is <code>TRUE</code>.  Component <code>data</code> is present only if
<code>keepdata</code> is <code>TRUE</code>.
</p>


<h3>Warning</h3>

<p>When <code>keepdata</code> is <code>TRUE</code>, the way that the data
is &ldquo;kept&rdquo; depends on the value of <code>bylevel</code>.
See <b>Value</b>.
</p>


<h3>Notes</h3>


<ul>
<li><p> Simulation experiments have given some evidence that
<code>Fest()</code> and <code>Gest()</code> and <code>Jest()</code> lead to tests
that have lower power than that obtained than tests obtained by
using <code>Kest()</code>.  The power obtained seems to be substantially
lower in the case of <code>Fest()</code> and <code>Gest()</code>, somewhat
lower in the case of <code>Jest()</code>.
</p>
<p>Consequently, users are advised to eschew the use of <code>Fest()</code>,
<code>Gest()</code> and <code>Jest()</code> (despite their ready availability)
and to stick with the default summary function <code>Kest()</code>.
Users should ignore this advice <em>only</em> if they have a sound
reason for doing so and a sound understanding of the consequences.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Only one-way and two-way (pseudo) analyses of variance
are accommodated.  If you feel inclined to ask why there is not
provision for higher order analysis of variance, just look at
the code and the answer should be obvious.  It <em>might</em> be
possible to implement higher order pseudo analysis of variance of
summary functions, but this is unlikely to have any practical use.
Writing the code would, for me, be a nightmare!

<h2 id='ripVar'>
The Ripley Variance of K-functions.
</h2><span id='topic+ripVar'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Calculates the variance of the K-function of a Poisson point pattern,
according to Ripley's formula (as taken from equation (3) in
Hahn 2012).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>ripVar(X, r)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table role = "presentation">
<tr><td><code id="ripVar_+3A_x">X</code></td>
<td>

<p>A point pattern (object of class <code>"ppp"</code>).  The variance
formula is valid only if <code>X</code> arises from a Poisson process.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="ripVar_+3A_r">r</code></td>
<td>

<p>A numeric vector of non-negative values at which the K-function
for <code>X</code> is to be evaluated.
</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The vector <code>r</code> would normally have entries in increasing
order and would have a first entry equal to 0.  It may be wise
to construct <code>r</code> as <code>Kest(X)$r</code>, but this is not
required.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A number vector, of length equal to <code>length(r)</code> whose
entries are the variances of <code>K(r)</code> where $K(r)$ is equal to
<code>as.function(Kest(X))</code>.
</p>

<h2 id='stomata'>
Stomata patterns
</h2><span id='topic+stomata'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Point patterns of stomata at 18 locations in each of 12 leaves of
<em>Michelia cavaleriei var. platypetala.</em>
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>stomata</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>The object <code>stomata</code> is a hyperframe with 216 rows.  It has
a column named <code>patterns</code> containing the point patterns of
stomata locations, a column named <code>Leaf</code> which is a factor
with levels 1 to 12 identifying the leaf from which the pattern
was obtained, a column named <code>Layer</code> which is a factor with
levels 1 to 6 identifying a location within each &ldquo;position&rdquo;
(see &ldquo;<code>Pos</code>&rdquo;), and a column named <code>Pos</code> which
is a factor with levels 1 to 3, position 1 being closest to the
central stem of the leaf and position 3 being closest to the
outer edge of the leaf (and farthest from the central stem).
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Each pattern was observed in a rectangular window of dimension
1200 <code class="reqn">\times</code> 900 microns.
</p>


<h3>Source</h3>

<p>The data were kindly supplied by Prof. Peijian Shi of the College
of Biology and the Environment, Nanjing Forestry University, Nanjing,
P.R. China.
