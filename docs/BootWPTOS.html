</h2><span id='topic+BootWPTOS-package'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This package contains two main functions to carry out
tests of second-order stationarity using wavelet packets.
One test, <code><a href="#topic+BootWPTOS">BootWPTOS</a></code> carries out the
bootstrap wavelet packet test of stationarity as described by
Cardinali and Nason (2016), with algorithm of that same name
in that paper. The test is carried out respect to a set of
wavelet packets (one, or more than one).
</p>
<p>The other main function is <code><a href="#topic+WPTOSpickout">WPTOSpickout</a></code>.
Here, the test is carried out using a fixed single wavelet
packet and inference for test statistics is carried out
using asymptotic normal approximations as described in
Cardinali and Nason (2016) but based on ideas in 
von Sachs and Neumann (2000).
</p>

<p>The main functions are documented above. See below for an example of
each.
</p>
<p>Both functions require the specification of a set (for <code><a href="#topic+BootWPTOS">BootWPTOS</a></code>)
or a single (for <code><a href="#topic+WPTOSpickout">WPTOSpickout</a></code>) wavelet packet.
This is because the tests use and rely on wavelet packets.
</p>
<p>Wavelet packets are indexed by two quantities: scale and index. The scale
is referred to in the functions by the <code>levs</code> and <code>level</code> arguments
respectively. Scale can be any scale that you would normally use in
wavethresh. So, for a series of dyadic length, that is T=2^J, the scales
are indexed 0 (coarsest scale) to J-1 (finest scale).
</p>
<p>The range of the index argument for a wavelet packet depends on the scale.
Always the scaling function coefficients have index 0 and the regular wavelet
coefficients always have index 1. Note: wavelets are a subset of wavelet
packets. Then, for scale J-j there are 2^j packets.
</p>
<p>So, for example, at the finest scale J-1 there are 2^1=2 packets. These
correspond to indices 0 and 1, the father and mother wavelet coefficients
respectively. For the next finest scale J-2 there are 2^2=4 packets. These
are indexed 0, 1, 2 and 3 with 0,1 being the father/mother wavelet
(packet) coefficients at that scale and indices 2 and 3 being the other
two wavelet packets at that scale. Clearly there are many more wavelet
packets at coarser scales. 
</p>
<p>In our functions the levs or level contains the scale of any wavelet
packet and the indices or index variable contains the indices.
</p>
<p>In <code><a href="#topic+BootWPTOS">BootWPTOS</a></code> you can use any combination of wavelet packets,
but it is important that the entries correspond to each other in the
levs and indices vector. E.g. if you wanted wavelet packet (3,5) and (4,7)
with J=5 then you would use the arguments levs=c(3,4) and indices=c(5,7).

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>#
# First, we provide an example concerning BootWPTOS
#
#
# Generate a stationary time series (e.g. iid standard normals)
#
x &lt;- rnorm(512)
#
# What would be the finest scale?
#
J &lt;- IsPowerOfTwo(length(x))
J
#[1] 9
#
# So, in WaveThresh there are 9 scaled indexed 0 to 8.
#
# Test x for stationarity
#
# The finest scale wavelets are at 8
# The next finest scale is 7.
#
# Wavelets themselves are always indexed 1, father wavelets 0.
# We don't tend to use father wavelets for stationary testing.
#
# There are 2^j packets at scale J-j (so 2 at the finest [father and
# mother], 4 at the next finest [father=0, mother=1, packets 2 and 3].
#
# Let's just look at the finest scale wavelets and the next finest
# scale wavelets and two other wavelet packets.
#
x.test &lt;- BootWPTOS(x=x, levs=c(8,7,7,7), indices=c(1,1,2,3), Bsims=30)
#
# Note: Bsims=30 is ALMOST CERTAINLY TOO SMALL (but it is small here because
# on installation R run these examples and I don't want it to take too long.
# 100+ is almost certainly necessary, and probably 500+ useful and 1000+
# to be "sure". If you can load the multicore library then you can
# replace lapplyfn=lapply with lapplyfn=mclapply to get a parallel processing
#
# What are the results of our test?
#
x.test
#
#       WPBootTOS test of stationarity
#
#data:  x
#= 1.8096, p-value = 0.7
#
# So, the p-value is &gt; 0.05 so this test indicates that there is
# no evidence for non-stationarity. Running it for 1000 bootstrap simulations
# gave a p-vale of 0.736.
#
# The next example is nonstationary. However, after the series has been
# generated you should plot it. The second half has a different variance
# to the first half but it is very difficult, usually, to identify the
# different variances on a plot.
#
x2 &lt;- c(rnorm(256), rnorm(256,sd=1.4))
#
# Let's do a test, but involve ALL non-father-wavelet packets from scales
# 8, 7, 6 and 5.
#
# NOTE: Typically we use much more than 50 bootstrap sims
#
#
x2.test &lt;- BootWPTOS(x=x2, levs=c(8,7,7,7,rep(6,7), rep(5,15)),
	indices=c(1,1,2,3, 1:7, 1:15), Bsims=30)
x2.test
#
#       WPBootTOS test of stationarity
#
#data:  x2
#= 5.4362, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16
#
# So, strong evidence for nonstationarity because p.value &lt; 0.05 (much less
# than!). 
# Using Bsims=1000 and mclapply (for speed) gave a p-value
# of 0.002, so still assessed to be nonstationary, but we have more confidence
# in the answer.
#
# Now we provide an example of using WPTOSpickout
#
#
# Create some simulated data
#
x2 &lt;- c(rnorm(256), rnorm(256, 2))
#
# Note: x2 should be highly nonstationary. The left-hand half of the series
# has variance 1, the right-hand half has variance 2.
#
# First, try out a wavelet packet test of stationarity. This is a check
# on the later test. You should really check both.
#
# We've chosen this packet more or less at random. Its packet at scale 5 and
# index 1 (this happens to be a wavelet)
#
# Again, typically we use more than 30 bootstrap sims, 30 is too small
#
x2.tos &lt;- BootWPTOS(x2, levs=5, indices=1, Bsims=30)

#
#       WPBootTOS test of stationarity
#
#data:  x2
#= 5.2826, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16
#
# So, test indicates that strong evidence for nonstationarity.
#
# Now let's do the multiple Haar hypothesis test.
#
x2.po &lt;- WPTOSpickout(x=x2, level=7, index=1)
x2.po
#Class 'toswp' : Wavelet Packet Test of Stationarity Object :
#       ~~~~  : List with 7 components with names
#              x level index sigcoefs nreject ntests bonsize
#
#
#summary(.):
#----------
#Number of individual tests: 56
#Bonferroni p-value was: 0.0008928571
#Tests rejected: 2
#Listing Bonferroni rejects...
#Wavelet Packet  (5,1): HWTlev: 4. Indices: 8
#Wavelet Packet  (5,1): HWTlev: 5. Indices: 16
#
# So, this test also shows nonstationarities. For this packet (5,1)
# two significant Haar coefficients were identified. One was at level 4
# position 8 and the other was at scale level 5 position 16.
#
# You can plot them also
#
plot(x2.po)
#
# You should get a nice plot of the time series with double-headed red
# arrows indicating the location and extent of the nonstationarities.
# For this example, where the spectrum changes dramatically at the halfway
# point - this is where the arrows should be located. Of course, with random
# data you might see other arrows in other locations, but this should be
# unlikely and on repeating the above they should not persist.

<h2 id='BootWPTOS'>Compute test of stationarity for time series via bootstrap
wavelet packet method.
</h2><span id='topic+BootWPTOS'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Computes b-spectrum (wavelet packet periodogram) for
predefined set of wavelet packets on time series. Then applies
bootstrap method to resample new versions of the (assumed for the
test) stationary series and retests the series. If the value of
the test statistic is out of line (bigger) than the resampled
test statistics then the series might well not be stationary.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Function computes a test statistic for test of stationarity
on a time series. Then successive bootstrap realizations are
drawn using the <code>surrogate</code> function. If the original time
series WAS stationary then <code>surrogate</code> causes stationary
draws with the same spectral characteristic as the data to be
produced (with Gaussian marginals). Under the null hypothesis
the time series is assumed stationary and so the distribution of
all of the test statistics should be the same and the p-value
of the test statistic be uniformly distributed. If the series
is nonstationary then the value of the statistic is likely
to be bigger on the first computed test statistic on the dats
and much bigger than all the others. We can work out a bootstrap
p-value by counting how many resampled test statistics are bigger
than the one computed on the data.
</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The nonstationarities are located by looking for significant
Haar wavelet coefficients of a b-spectrum of a time series (a b-spectrum
is the expectation of a wavelet packet periodgram). The significant
Haar coefficients can locate discontinuities in space and time.

<p>Keep away from coarse scales. Typically, Haar wavelet
coefficients at the coarse scales are contaminated by boundary
effects. These won't usually cause a problem at scales 3 or higher,
or maybe 2. Only coefficients at scales <code>lowlev</code> or finer
will be selected for testing.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="WPTOSpickout_+3A_highlev">highlev</code></td>
<td>
<p>Keep away from fine scales. The testing of Haar
wavelet coeffients depends on utilizing enough data points
to enable asymptotic normality to kick in. At the finest scale
only TWO single points are compared and the distribution of each
point might be far from normality. At coarser scales TWO averages
are compared and those averages will consist of many points.
E.g. at the third finest scale each average will consist of four
points, at the fourth finest scale each average will consist of
8 points, etc. By default this argument is set to be roughly the
use a scale one level finer than the halfway number of levels.
So, if J=10, then highlev is 6. The formula is
floor(J/2)+1. Note: highlev and lowlev should be specified
in the WaveThresh scaling (e.g. scale 0 is the coarsest scale)

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function computes the nondecimated wavelet packet
transform of the packet you specified by
<code>level</code> and <code>index</code>. Note: you can only specify
one number for each of these. Then the b-spectrum (raw
wavelet packet periodogram) is formed by squaring the
nondecimated wavelet packet transform. Then the Haar
wavelet coefficients are obtained for the b-spectrum and
a multiple hypothesis test is performed on all the Haar
wavelet coefficients between scales lowlev and highlev.
The function return information about any significant wavelet
coefficients.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Description says it all. However, the <code>levs</code> and
<code>indices</code> warrant further explanation.
</p>
<p>Our code is designed to be used on data sets that are a power
of two, i.e. T = 2^J for some J (note: the test can work on
other values of T but coding is more finickity). Given a series of this
length there are J levels, labelled 0 (coarse) to J-1 fine. Within each
level there are J-j packets indexed 0, 1, ..., J-j-1 for scales
J-1, ..., 0 respectively.
</p>
<p>Packet 0 within any scale always corresponds to the father wavelets
at that scale and we don't tend to use this for stationarity testing.
Packet 1 within any scale always corresponds to mother wavelets. We often
use these. Note, at the finest scale J-1 there are only two packets
0 (father wavelet) and 1 (mother wavelet) coefficients.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The test statistic value is returned.
