Dandelion Plot 
</h2><span id='topic+dandelion'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A Dandelion plot for R-mode Exploratory Factor Analysis methods. The loading matrix and the factor variances are being visualized. 
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'> 
dandelion(fact_load, bound = 0.5, mcex=c(1,1), palet)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table role = "presentation">
<tr><td><code id="dandelion_+3A_fact_load">fact_load</code></td>
<td>
<p>A &quot;loadings&quot; class object. Factor loading matrix. 
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="dandelion_+3A_bound">bound</code></td>
<td>

<p>Minimum loadings to visualize. It should be set between 0 and 1. For example, bound=0.5 will only visualize loadings more than 0.5.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="dandelion_+3A_mcex">mcex</code></td>
<td>

<p>A vector with two points. First value determines the size of labels within dandelion plot, and the second determines the size of labels within uniquenesses and communalities graphs
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="dandelion_+3A_palet">palet</code></td>
<td>

<p>A vector of color pallette. The first and the last elements of the vector are the colors of positive and negative loadings. 
</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>A Dandelion Plot visualizes both factor variances and loadings in the same time. Each central line represents a different factor and is connected to a star graph. These star graphs visualize the factor loadings for the corresponding factor. Negative and positive loadings are indicated by two different colors. Explained variance of each factor can be observed by the size of each star graph or by the angle between the current and the consecutive central line. For example, explained variance of first factor is determined by the angle between the first and second central line. 
Communalities and uniquenesses are also given on the right hand side along barchart of cummulative explanation ratios of factors (with individual variances on top).

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function produces a factor loading matrix given by the specified factor extraction method, number of factors and rotation method. R-mode Exploratory Factor Analysis is based on the factorization of the variables. See &quot;References&quot; for more details.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>factload(data, cormeth = "spearman", data.cor, 
         method = "pc", nfac = 1, rotation = "varimax")
</code></pre>

Science Perception of Eigth Grade Students, TIMSS 2011
</h2><span id='topic+timss2011'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The data set on the perception of science and attitude towards science for eigth grade students in Turkey data of TIMSS 2011. Data set is obtained from TIMSS 2011 Student Questionnaire. Among 42 questions, first 16 questions are on students' general opinion about school, and last 26 questions are on students' attitude and perception towards science lessons. The variables are measured with likert type scale with four choices where '1' indicates &quot;Every Day or Almost Every Day / Agree A Lot / At Least Once A Week&quot; and '4' indicates &quot;Never or Almost Never / Disagree A Lot / Never&quot; depending on the question. 
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>data(timss2011)</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>Data consists of 6925 students with their 42 perception variables. Variables have been assigned according to last three letters of their coding in the questionnaire.
