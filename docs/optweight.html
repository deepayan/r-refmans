<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The purpose of <code>check.targets</code> is to allow users to ensure that their proposed input to <code>targets</code> in <code><a href="#topic+optweight">optweight</a></code> and <code><a href="#topic+optweight.svy">optweight.svy</a></code> is correct both in the number of entries and their order. This is especially important when factor variables and interactions are included in the formula because factor variables are split into several dummies and interactions are moved to the end of the variable list, both of which can cause some confusion and potential error when entering <code>targets</code> values.
</p>
<p>Factor variables are internally split into a dummy variable for each level, so the user must specify a target population mean value for each level of the factor. These must add up to 1, and an error will be displayed if they do not. These values represent the proposrtion of units in the target population with each factor level.
</p>
<p>Interactions (e.g., <code>a:b</code> or <code>a*b</code> in the <code>formula</code> input) are always sent to the end of the variable list even if they are specified elsewhere in the <code>formula</code>. It is important to run <code>check.targets</code> to ensure the order of the proposed <code>targets</code> corresponds to the represented order of covariates used in the formula. You can run <code>check.targets</code> with <code>targets = NULL</code> to see the order of covariates that is required without specifying any targets.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>An <code>optweight.targets</code> object, which is a named vector of target population mean values, one for each (expanded) covariate specified in <code>formula</code>. This should be used as user inputs to <code><a href="#topic+optweight">optweight</a></code> and <code><a href="#topic+optweight.svy">optweight.svy</a></code>.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The purpose of <code>check.tols</code> is to allow users to ensure that their proposed input to <code>tols</code> in <code><a href="#topic+optweight">optweight</a></code> is correct both in the number of entries and their order. This is especially important when factor variables and interactions are included in the formula because factor variables are split into several dummies and interactions are moved to the end of the variable list, both of which can cause some confusion and potential error when entering <code>tols</code> values.
</p>
<p>Factor variables are internally split into a dummy variable for each level, but the user only needs to specify one tolerance value per original variable; <code>check.tols</code> automatically expands the <code>tols</code> input to match the newly created variables.
</p>
<p>Interactions (e.g., <code>a:b</code> or <code>a*b</code> in the <code>formula</code> input) are always sent to the end of the variable list even if they are specified elsewhere in the <code>formula</code>. It is important to run <code>check.tols</code> to ensure the order of the proposed <code>tols</code> corresponds to the represented order of covariates used in <code>optweight</code>. You can run <code>check.tols</code> with no <code>tols</code> input to see the order of covariates that is required.
</p>
<p><code>check.tols</code> was designed to be used primarily for its message printing and <code>print</code> method, but you can also assign its output to an object for use as an input to <code>tols</code> in <code>optweight</code>.
</p>
<p>Note that only one formula and vector of tolerance values can be assessed at a time; for multiple treatment periods, each formula and tolerance vector must be entered seperately.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>An <code>optweight.tols</code> object, which is a named vector of tolerance values, one for each variable specified in <code>formula</code>. This should be used as user inputs to <code><a href="#topic+optweight">optweight</a></code>. The <code>"internal.tols"</code> attribute contains the tolerance values to be used internally by <code>optweight</code>. These will differ from the vector values when there are factor variables that are split up; the user only needs to submit one tolerance per factor variable, but seperate tolerance values are produced for each new dummy created.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The optimization is performed by the lower-level function <code><a href="#topic+optweight.fit">optweight.fit</a></code> using <code><a href="osqp.html#topic+solve_osqp">solve_osqp</a></code> in the <span class="pkg">osqp</span> package, which provides a straightforward interface to specifying the constraints and objective function for quadratic optimization problems and uses a fast and flexible solving algorithm.
</p>
<p>For binary and multinomial treatments, weights are estimated so that the weighted mean differences of the covariates are within the given tolerance thresholds (unless <code>std.binary</code> or <code>std.cont</code> are <code>TRUE</code>, in which case standardized mean differences are considered for binary and continuous variables, respectively). For a covariate <code class="reqn">x</code> with specified tolerance <code class="reqn">\delta</code>, the weighted means of each each group will be within <code class="reqn">\delta</code> of each other. Additionally, when the ATE is specified as the estimand or a target population is specified, the weighted means of each group will each be within <code class="reqn">\delta/2</code> of the target means; this ensures generalizability to the same population from which the original sample was drawn.
</p>
<p>If standardized tolerance values are requested, the standardization factor corresponds to the estimand requested: when the ATE is requested or a target population specified, the standardization factor is the square root of the average variance for that covariate across treatment groups, and when the ATT or ATC are requested, the standardization factor is the standard deviation of the covariate in the focal group. The standardization factor is always unweighted.
</p>
<p>For continuous treatments, weights are estimated so that the weighted correlation between the treatment and each covariate is within the specified tolerance threshold. If the ATE is requested or a target population is specified, the means of the weighted covariates and treatment are restricted to be equal to those of the target population to ensure generalizability to the desired target population. The weighted correlation is computed as the weighted covariance divided by the product of the <em>unweighted</em> standard deviations. The means used to center the variables in computing the covariance are those specified in the target population.
</p>
<p>For longitudinal treatments, only &quot;wide&quot; data sets, where each row corresponds to a unit's entire variable history, are supported. You can use <code><a href="stats.html#topic+reshape">reshape</a></code> or other functions to transform your data into this format; see example in the documentation for <code>weightitMSM</code> in the <span class="pkg">WeightIt</span> package. Currently, longtiduinal treatments are not recommended as optweight's use with them has not been validated.
</p>


<h4>Dual Variables</h4>

<p>Two types of constriants may be associated with each covariate: target constraints and balance constraints. Target constraints require the mean of the covariate to be at (or near) a specific target value in each treatment group (or for the whole group when treatment is continuous). Balance constraints require the means of the covariate in pairs of treatments to be near each other. For binary and multinomial treatments, balance constraints are redundant if target constraints are provided for a variable. For continuous variables, balance constraints refer to the correlation between treatment and the covariate and are not redundant with target constraints. In the <code>duals</code> component of the output, each covariate has a dual variable for each nonredundant constraint placed on it.
</p>
<p>The dual variable for each constraint is the instantaneous rate of change of the objective function at the optimum due to a change in the constraint. Because this relationship is not linear, large changes in the constraint will not exactly map onto corresponding changes in the objective function at the optimum, but will be close for small changes in the constraint. For example, for a covariate with a balance constraint of .01 and a corresponding dual variable of .4, increasing (i.e., relaxing) the constraint to .025 will decrease the value of the objective function at the optimum by approximately (.025 - .01) * .4 = .006. When the L2 norm is used, this change corresponds to a change in the variance of the weights, which directly affects the effective sample size (though the magnitude of this effect depends on the original value of the effective sample size).
</p>
<p>For factor variables, <code>optweight</code> takes the sum of the absolute dual variables for the constraints for all levels and reports it as the the single dual variable for the variable itself. This summed dual variable works the same way as dual variables for continuous variables do.
</p>



<h4>Solving Convergence Failure</h4>

<p>Sometimes the optimization will fail to converge at a solution. There are a variety of reasons why this might happen, which include that the constraints are nearly impossible to satisfy or that the optimization surface is relatively flat. It can be hard to know the exact cause or how to solve it, but this section offers some solutions one might try.
</p>
<p>Rarely is the problem too few iterations, though this is possible. Most problems can be solved in the default 200,000 iterations, but sometimes it can help to increase this number with the <code>max_iter</code> argument. Usually, though, this just ends up taking more time without a solution found.
</p>
<p>If the problem is that the constraints are too tight, it can be helpful to loosen the constraints. Sometimes examining the dual variables of a solution that has failed to converge can reveal which constraints are causing the problem.
</p>
<p>Sometimes a suboptimal solution is possible; such a solution does not satisfy the constraints exactly but will come pretty close. To allow these solutions, the arguments <code>eps_abs</code> and <code>eps_rel</code> can be increased from 1E-8 to larger values. These should be adjusted together since they both must be satisfied for convergence to occur; this can be done easily using the shortcut argument <code>eps</code>, which changes both <code>eps_abs</code> and <code>eps_rel</code> to the set value.
</p>
<p>With continuous treatments, solutions that failed to converge may still be useable. Make sure to assess balance and examine the weights even after a optimal solution is not found, because the solution that is found may be good enough.

If <code>NULL</code> or all <code>NA</code>, <code>estimand</code> will be used to determine targets. Otherwise, <code>estimand</code> is ignored.

The L1 norm minimizes the average absolute distance between each weight and the mean of the weights; the L2 norm minimizes the variance of the weights; the L<code class="reqn">\infty</code> norm minimizes the largest weight.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>optweight.fit</code> transforms the inputs into the required inputs for <code><a href="osqp.html#topic+solve_osqp">solve_osqp</a></code>, which are (sparse) matrices and vectors, and then supplies the outputs (the weights, duals variables, and convergence information) back to <code>optweight</code>. No processing of inputs is performed, as this is normally handled by <code>optweight</code>.
</p>
<p>The default values for some of the parameters sent to <code>solve_osqp</code> are not the same as those in <code>osqpSettings</code>. The following are the differences: <code>max_iter</code> is set to 20000 and <code>eps_abs</code> and <code>eps_rel</code> are set to 1E-8 (i.e., 10^-8). All other values are the same.
</p>
<p>Note that optweights with longitudinal treatments are not valid and should not be used until further research is done.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The optimization is performed by the lower-level function <code><a href="#topic+optweight.svy.fit">optweight.svy.fit</a></code> using <code><a href="osqp.html#topic+solve_osqp">solve_osqp</a></code> in the <span class="pkg">osqp</span> package, which provides a straightforward interface to specifying the constraints and objective function for quadratic optimization problems and uses a fast and flexible solving algorithm.
</p>
<p>Weights are estimated so that the standardized differences between the weighted covariate means and the corresponding targets are within the given tolerance thresholds (unless <code>std.binary</code> or <code>std.cont</code> are <code>FALSE</code>, in which case unstandardized mean differences are considered for binary and continuous variables, respectively). For a covariate <code class="reqn">x</code> with specified tolerance <code class="reqn">\delta</code>, the weighted mean will be within <code class="reqn">\delta</code> of the target. If standardized tolerance values are requested, the standardization factor is the standard deviation of the covariate in the whole sample. The standardization factor is always unweighted.

<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table role = "presentation">
<tr><td><code id="optweight.svy.fit_+3A_covs">covs</code></td>
<td>

<p>A matrix of covariates to be targeted. Should must be numeric but does not have to be full rank.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="optweight.svy.fit_+3A_tols">tols</code></td>
<td>

<p>A vector of target balance tolerance values.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="optweight.svy.fit_+3A_targets">targets</code></td>
<td>

<p>A vector of target populaton mean values for each covariate. The resulting weights will yield sample means within <code>tols</code> units of the target values for each covariate. If any target values are <code>NA</code>, the corresponding variable will not be targeted and its weighted mean will be wherever the weights yield the smallest variance. To ensure the weighted mean for a covairate is equal to its unweighted mean (i.e., so that its orginal mean is its target mean), its original mean must be supplied as a target.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="optweight.svy.fit_+3A_s.weights">s.weights</code></td>
<td>

<p>A vector of sampling weights. Optimization occurs on the product of the sampling weights and the estimated weights.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="optweight.svy.fit_+3A_norm">norm</code></td>
<td>

<p>A string containing the name of the norm corresponding to the objective function to minimize. The options are <code>"l1"</code> for the L1 norm, <code>"l2"</code> for the L2 norm (the default), and <code>"linf"</code> for the L<code class="reqn">\infty</code> norm. The L1 norm minimizes the average absolute distance between each weight and the mean of the weights; the L2 norm minimizes the variance of the weights; the L<code class="reqn">\infty</code> norm minimizes the largest weight. The L2 norm has a direct correspondence with the effective sample size, making it ideal if this is your criterion of interest.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="optweight.svy.fit_+3A_std.binary">std.binary</code>, <code id="optweight.svy.fit_+3A_std.cont">std.cont</code></td>
<td>

<p><code>logical</code>; whether the tolerances are in standardized mean units (<code>TRUE</code>) or raw units (<code>FALSE</code>) for binary variables and continuous variables, respectively. The default is <code>FALSE</code> for <code>std.binary</code> because raw proportion differences make more sense than standardized mean difference for binary variables.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="optweight.svy.fit_+3A_min.w">min.w</code></td>
<td>

<p>A single <code>numeric</code> value between 0 and 1 for the smallest allowable weight. Some analyses require nonzero weights for all units, so a small, nonzero minimum may be desirable. Doing so will likely (slightly) increase the variance of the resulting weights depending on the magntiude of the minimum. The default is 1e-8, which does not materially change the properties of the weights from a minimum of 0 but prevents warnings in some packages that use weights to estimate treatment effects.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="optweight.svy.fit_+3A_verbose">verbose</code></td>
<td>

<p>Whether information on the optimization problem solution should be printed. This information contains how many iterations it took to estimate the weights and whether the solution is optimal.
</p>
</td></tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>optweight.svy.fit</code> transforms the inputs into the required inputs for <code><a href="osqp.html#topic+solve_osqp">solve_osqp</a></code>, which are (sparse) matrices and vectors, and then supplies the outputs (the weights, duals variables, and convergence information) back to <code>optweight.svy</code>. No processing of inputs is performed, as this is normally handled by <code>optweight.svy</code>.
</p>

<p>An <code>optweight.svy.fit</code> object with the following elements:
</p>
<table role = "presentation">
<tr><td><code>w</code></td>
<td>
<p>The estimated weights, one for each unit.</p>

Plot Dual Variables for Assessing Balance Constraints
</h2><span id='topic+plot.optweight'></span><span id='topic+plot.optweight.svy'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Plots the dual variables resulting from <code>optweight</code> in a way similar to figure 2 of Zubizarreta (2015), which explained how to interpret these values. These represent the cost of changing the constraint on the variance of the resulting weights. For covariates with large values of the dual variable, tightening the constraint will increase the variability of the weights, and loosening the constraint will decrease the variability of the weights, both to a greater extent than would doing the same for covariate with small values of the dual variable.
