<td>Description:</td>
<td>Simulation-based sensitivity analysis for causal mediation studies. It numerically and graphically evaluates the sensitivity of causal mediation analysis results 
 to the presence of unmeasured pretreatment confounding. The proposed method has primary advantages over existing methods. 
 First, using an unmeasured pretreatment confounder conditional associations with the treatment, mediator, and outcome as 
 sensitivity parameters, the method enables users to intuitively assess sensitivity in reference to prior knowledge about the 
 strength of a potential unmeasured pretreatment confounder. Second, the method accurately reflects the influence of unmeasured 
 pretreatment confounding on the efficiency of estimation of the causal effects. Third, the method can be implemented in 
 different causal mediation analysis approaches, including regression-based, simulation-based, and propensity score-based 
 methods. It is applicable to both randomized experiments and observational studies.</td>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function is used to evaluate the sensitivity of the estimated natural direrct and indirect effects to potential violations of the ignorability assumptions. It estimates the natural direct and indirect effects after adjusting for an unmeasured pretreatment confounder, U, with a specified degree of confounding. In a randomized experiment, the degree of confounding is evaluated via two sensitivity parameters, the coefficient of U in the mediator model and that in the outcome model, given the specified prior distribution of U. When the treatment is not randomized, an additional sensitivity parameter is introduced &ndash; the coefficient of U in the treatment model. The mediator, outcome, and unmeasured pretreatment confounder could be either binary or continuous, while the treatment has to be binary. If the treatment is randomized, the sensitivity analysis method is applicable to various causal mediation analysis methods, including the ratio of mediator probability weights (RMPW) method, the regression-based method proposed by VanderWeele (2010), and the simulation-based method proposed by Imai et al. (2010a, 2010b). If the treatment is not randomized, the method is applicable to the RMPW method. To reduce the risk of model misspecifications, we account for the interaction between the treatment and each observed pretreatment covariate in the mediator model.

<p>The method to be used in the estimation of the causal mediation effects. &quot;rmpw&quot; uses the weighting-based method. It estimates the natural direct and indirect effects through mean contrasts of the outcome. When the outcome is coninuous, it controls for the pretreatment confounders in the outcome model for improving efficiency. When the outcome is binary, it cannot control for the pretreatment confounders. In addition to the scenario with a binary mediator and a continuous outcome, we use bootstrapping to estimate their standard errors and test their significance. &quot;regression&quot; uses the regression-based method developed by VanderWeele and Vansteelandt (2009). It is only applicable to continuous outcomes, because when the outcome is binary, the natural direct and indirect effects are identified on the odds ratio scale, rendering results difficult to report. Because the estimator of the natural direct effect or the natural indirect effect is a complex combination of regression coefficients and may not follow a normal distribution, we use bootstrapping to estimate their standard errors and test their significance. &quot;simulation&quot; uses the simulation-based method developed by Imai et al. (2010a, 2010b), and the mediation package is adopted. For a binary mediator or outcome, the link function is always specified to be logit. If t.rand = FALSE, i.e the treatment is not randomized, only rmpw is applicable.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function is used to visually represent the sensitivity analysis results when the treatment is randomized. Each black contour represents the combinations of sensitivity parameters that lead to the same indirect effect estimate as indicated by the number on the contour. The sensitivity parameters along the red dashed curves reduce the estimate to zero. In the region between the two blue dotted curves that bracket the red curve, the effect is changed to be insignificant at the significance level of 0.05. The larger the magnitudes of the sensitivity parameters are for removing the effects or changing their significance, the less sensitive the results are. Each dot corresponds to the conditional associations of each observed covariate with the outcome and the mediator, which are used to calibrate the strength of the sensitivity parameters.
