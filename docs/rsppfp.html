<h2 id='direct_graph'>Undirected Graph Translator</h2><span id='topic+direct_graph'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The SPPFP transformation functions only work with digraphs -i.e. directed graphs.
Because in a digraph arcs can only be traveled in one direction, from the origin node to the
destination arc, if undirected graphs are used as-is, the resultng G* will not be accurate.
Therefore, this functions translates an undirected graph to a
digraph by duplicating each arc and swapping the duplicate's <code>from</code> and <code>to</code> nodes.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>direct_graph(graph, cores = 1L)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr><td><code id="direct_graph_+3A_graph">graph</code></td>
<td>
<p>An undirected graph written as a data frame, in which each rows represent an arc. 
The columns must be named <code>from</code> and <code>to</code>, and can be of any data type. Each row
can have additional attributes, and no cells can be <code>NULL</code> or <code>NA</code>.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="direct_graph_+3A_cores">cores</code></td>
<td>
<p>This algorithm can be run using R's parallel processing functions. This variable
represents the number of processing cores you want to assign for the transformation. The 
default value is one single core. It is suggested to not assign all of your available cores
to the function.</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A new graph, with the same columns and data types of the original graph. This new
graph is twice as big as the original, as new arcs are added to represent that each arc can 
be traveled in both directions.

<h2 id='get_all_nodes'>Parser for G* nodes.</h2><span id='topic+get_all_nodes'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A original node N_i can appear on a transformed G* as different nodes.
This is the result of the creation of nodes in the transformation processes. Therefore,
it is possible that the original node N does not exists on G*, or that multiple N_i*
exist. Hence, as all new nodes are generated using a specific structure for the name
-compiling all previous nodes names, split by pipe-, this function allows searching
for all the N_i* nodes that are equivalente to N_i. This can be used to find shortest 
paths to all of them.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>get_all_nodes(g, originalNode)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr><td><code id="get_all_nodes_+3A_g">g</code></td>
<td>
<p>A graph in data frame format, translated using one of the available functions.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="get_all_nodes_+3A_originalnode">originalNode</code></td>
<td>
<p>The name of the original node from G, that needs to be searched
within G*. It is preferable to use a character format, but this can also be of any
simple type. No lists or vectors are allowed.</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A new vector of character type, whose elements are all the N_i* equivalent to
the original N node. This also includes the original node.

<hr>
<h2 id='get_shortest_path'>igraph Shortest Path</h2><span id='topic+get_shortest_path'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A original node N_i can appear on a transformed gStar as different N_i* equivalent
nodes. Therefore, this becomes a limitation when searching for a shortest path inside gStar.
As a result: all N_i* need to be considered as possible destination nodes when looking for
the shortest path. This function is a wrapper for this behavior, providing a straightforward
implementation using igraph capabilities. However, it aims to provide
guidance on how to build a similar algorithm for different path-finding algorithms.
</p>
<p>It is important to mention that new nodes are only considered as destination nodes, and they
are not search for origin nodes. This is because N* nodes can only be reached after traveling
through gStar nodes. For example, a node <code>"f|e|r"</code> is actually indicating that <code>"r"</code>
has been reached after traveling through the nodes <code>"f"</code> and <code>"e"</code>.

original graph, nodes on the new graph are of type character. The new nodes names are
generated by incrementally concatenating the nodes on a forbidden path, but split by a
pipe character (<code>|</code>). The new graph includes all of the additional attributes
that the original graph had.

<h2 id='parse_vpath'>Parser for G* nodes paths.</h2><span id='topic+parse_vpath'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Translates a sequence of nodes from a G* graph, generated with any of the 
available transformations, to a sequence of nodes in terms of the original G.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>parse_vpath(vpath)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr><td><code id="parse_vpath_+3A_vpath">vpath</code></td>
<td>
<p>A vector of character type, representing a path as a sequence of nodes. The nodes
are supposed to belong to an original graph G, but be written in terms of G*.</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A new vector of character type, representing the same path as <code>vpath</code> but with 
the nodes names translated to the original graph G's names.

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Transformation algorithms to translate the SPPFP (Shortest Path Problem with Forbidden
Paths) to a traditional shortest-path problem that includes the forbidden paths.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The SPPFP is a variant of the traditional shortest path problem, in which no solution
can include any path listed on a known set of forbidden paths. The current approach
to solve this is to translate the existing graph, and its set of forbidden paths,
to a graph in which no path will include any forbidden sequence.
This package provides straightforward parallel processing capabilities, as well as
translation functions to use the algorithms on undirected graphs. It is highly
compatible with other network research packages, as it only uses native R data types.
