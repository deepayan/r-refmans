<td>Description:</td>
<td>The least-squares Monte Carlo (LSM) simulation method is a popular method for the approximation of the value of early and multiple exercise options. 'LSMRealOptions' provides implementations of the LSM simulation method to value American option products and capital investment projects through real options analysis. 'LSMRealOptions' values capital investment projects with cash flows dependent upon underlying state variables that are stochastically evolving, providing analysis into the timing and critical values at which investment is optimal. 'LSMRealOptions' provides flexibility in the stochastic processes followed by underlying assets, the number of state variables, basis functions and underlying asset characteristics to allow a broad range of assets to be valued through the LSM simulation method. Real options projects are further able to be valued whilst considering construction periods, time-varying initial capital expenditures and path-dependent operational flexibility including the ability to temporarily shutdown or permanently abandon projects after initial investment has occurred. The LSM simulation method was first presented in the prolific work of Longstaff and Schwartz (2001) &lt;<a href="https://doi.org/10.1093%2Frfs%2F14.1.113">doi:10.1093/rfs/14.1.113</a>&gt;.</td>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The <code>LSM_american_option</code> function provides an implementation of the least-squares Monte Carlo (LSM) simulation approach to numerically approximate
the value of American-style options (options with early exercise opportunities). The function provides flexibility in the stochastic process followed by the underlying asset, with simulated values
of stochastic processes provided within the <code>state_variables</code> argument. It also provides flexibility in the payoffs of the option, allowing for vanilla as well as more exotic options to be considered.
<code>LSM_american_option</code> also provides analysis into the exercise timing and probability of early exercise of the option.
</p>
<p><b>Least-Squares Monte Carlo Simulation:</b>
</p>
<p>The least-squares Monte Carlo (LSM) simulation method is a numeric approach first presented by Longstaff and Schwartz (2001) that
approximates the value of options with early exercise opportunities. The LSM simulation method is considered one of the most efficient
methods of valuing American-style options due to its flexibility and computational efficiency. The approach can feature multiple
stochastically evolving underlying uncertainties, following both standard and exotic stochastic processes.
</p>
<p>The LSM method first approximates stochastic variables through a stochastic process to develop cross-sectional information,
then directly estimates the continuation value of in-the-money simulation paths by &quot;(regressing) the ex-post realized payoffs from
continuation on functions of the values of the state variables&quot; (Longstaff and Schwartz, 2001).
</p>
<p>The 'LSM_american_option' function at each discrete time period, for each simulated price path, compares the payoff that results from immediate exercise of
the option with the expected value of continuing to hold the option for subsequent periods. The payoff of immediate exercise is provided in the <code>payoff</code> argument and
could take several different meanings depending upon the type of American-style option being valued (e.g. the current stock price, the maximum price between multiple assets, etc.).
</p>
<p>The immediate profit resulting from exercise of the option is dependent upon the type of option being calculated. The profit of price path <code class="reqn">i</code> and time <code class="reqn">t</code>
is given by:
</p>
<p>When <code>call = TRUE</code>:
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">profit_{(t,i)} = max(payoff_{(t,i)} - K, 0)</code>
</p>

<p>When <code>call = FALSE</code>:
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">profit_{(t,i)} = max(K - payoff_{(t,i)}, 0)</code>
</p>

<p><b>Orthogonal Polynomials:</b>
</p>
<p>To improve the accuracy of estimation of continuation values, the economic values in each period are regressed on a linear
combination of a set of basis functions of the stochastic variables. These estimated regression parameters and the simulated
stochastic variables are then used to calculate the estimator for the expected economic values.
</p>
<p>Longstaff and Schwartz (2001) state that as the conditional expectation of the continuation value belongs to a Hilbert space,
it can be represented by a combination of orthogonal basis functions. Increasing the number of stochastic state variables
therefore increases the number of required basis functions exponentially. The orthogonal polynomials available in the
<code>LSMRealOptions</code> package are: Laguerre, Jacobi, Legendre (spherical), Hermite (probabilistic), Chebyshev (of the first kind).
The simple powers of state variables is further available. Explicit expressions of each of these orthogonal polynomials are
available within the textbook of Abramowitz and Stegun (1965).
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The 'LSM_american_option' function by default returns a <code>numeric</code> object corresponding to the calculated value of the American-style option.
</p>
<p>When <code>verbose = T</code>, 6 objects are returned within a <code>list</code> class object. The objects returned are:

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The <code>LSM_real_option</code> function provides an implementation of the least-squares Monte Carlo (LSM) simulation approach to numerically approximate
the value of capital investment projects considering the flexibility of timing of investment under stochastically evolving uncertainty. The function provides flexibility in the stochastic behavior of the underlying uncertainty, with simulated values
of state variables provided within the <code>state_variables</code> argument. The <code>LSM_real_option</code> function also provides analysis into the expected investment timing, probability, and the expected payback period of the project.
</p>
<p><b>Least-Squares Monte Carlo Simulation:</b>
</p>
<p>The least-squares Monte Carlo (LSM) simulation method is a numeric approach first presented by Longstaff and Schwartz (2001) that
approximates the value of options with early exercise opportunities. The LSM simulation method is considered one of the most efficient
methods of valuing American-style options due to its flexibility and computational efficiency. The approach can feature multiple
stochastically evolving underlying uncertainties, following both standard and exotic stochastic processes.
</p>
<p>The LSM method first approximates stochastic variables through a stochastic process to develop cross-sectional information,
then directly estimates the continuation value of in-the-money simulation paths by &quot;(regressing) the ex-post realized payoffs from
continuation on functions of the values of the state variables&quot; (Longstaff and Schwartz, 2001).
</p>
<p><b>Real Options Analysis</b>
</p>
<p>Real options analysis of investment projects considers the value of the option to delay investment in a project until
underlying, stochastically evolving uncertainty has revealed itself. Real options analysis treats investment into capital investment projects as an optimal stopping problem, optimizing the timing of investment that maximizes the payoffs of investment under underlying stochastic uncertainty.
Real options analysis is also capable of evaluating the critical value of underlying state variables at which immediate investment into a project is optimal. See Dixit and Pindyck (1994) for more details of real options analysis.
</p>
<p>The <code>LSM_real_option</code> function considers the option to invest into a capital investment project within a finite forecasting horizon. Investment into the project results in accruing all future net cash flows (NCF) until the end of the forecasting horizon at the cost of the capital expenditure (CAPEX).
Immediate investment into a capital investment project is optimal when the waiting option value (WOV) is zero. Critical values of state variables at which immediate investment in optimal can therefore be obtained through finding the root of the WOV.
</p>
<p>The primary difference between the <code>LSM_real_option</code> and <code>LSM.AmericanOption</code> function is the way in which they evaluate the payoff of
exercise of the American-style option. The <code>LSM.AmericanOption</code> function considers the payoff of exercise to be a one time payoff (i.e. buying or selling the security in a vanilla call or put option) corresponding to the respective payoff argument.
The <code>LSM_real_option</code> function instead, at each discrete time period, for each simulated price path, compares the sum of all remaining discounted cash flows that are accrued following immediate investment into
a project to the end of the forecasting horizon with the expected value of delaying investment. This is is known as the 'running present value' (RPV) of the project, which is the discretised present value of all
future cash flows of the project. The RPV of a project increases as the size of the discrete time step decreases, highlighting the need
for small discrete time steps to accurately value investment projects. This is due to the discounting effect of discounting larger
cash flows over greater time periods compared to smaller cash flows being discounted more frequently.
</p>
<p><b>Orthogonal Polynomials:</b>
</p>
<p>To improve the accuracy of estimation of continuation values, the economic values in each period are regressed on a linear
combination of a set of basis functions of the stochastic variables. These estimated regression parameters and the simulated
stochastic variables are then used to calculate the estimator for the expected economic values.
</p>
<p>Longstaff and Schwartz (2001) state that as the conditional expectation of the continuation value belongs to a Hilbert space,
it can be represented by a combination of orthogonal basis functions. Increasing the number of stochastic state variables
therefore increases the number of required basis functions exponentially. The orthogonal polynomials available in the
<code>LSM_real_options</code> package are: Laguerre, Jacobi, Legendre (spherical), Hermite (probabilistic), Chebyshev (of the first kind).
The simple powers of state variables is further available. Explicit expressions of each of these orthogonal polynomials are
available within the textbook of Abramowitz and Stegun (1965).

The simple powers of state variables is further available. Explicit expressions of each of these orthogonal polynomials are
available within the textbook of Abramowitz and Stegun (1965).
</p>
<p><b>Operational Flexibility:</b>
</p>
<p>Operational flexibility is adjustment made to a project in response to, or anticipation of, positive or negative economic outcomes
that occur after a project has begun. Operational flexibility has the ability to mitigate the effect of poor timing of initial
investment by maximizing gains and minimizing losses. Operational flexibility that reduces losses in response to negative economic
conditions (e.g. output prices falling to levels where operations are no longer profitable) reduce the irreversibility of initial
investment into a project. This is particularly valuable for investment projects in highly competitive business operating conditions,
high initial investment costs, long residual lifetimes of operations, high levels of volatility in underlying assets and net present
values near zero.
</p>
<p>The operational flexibility supported by the <code>LSM_real_option_OF</code> function is the ability to temporarily suspend and permanently
abandon an operational investment project. The ability to temporarily suspend and permanently abandon operations was first presented
in the prolific work of Brennan and Schwartz (1985), whom solved for the trigger values of suspension, resumption and abandonment of
a finite natural resource investment under natural resource price uncertainty. The work of Cortazar, Gravet and Urzua (2008) solved
this optimal switching problem using the LSM simulation method.
</p>
<p>Operational flexibilities are path dependent, compound and mutually exclusive real options. Under consideration of operational
flexibility, there are several different &quot;states&quot; or operating modes available for an investment project. These are:
</p>
<p>* Not yet invested
* Operational
* Suspended
* Abandoned
</p>
<p>With the &quot;Under construction&quot; state further considered when construction time is also considered.
</p>
<p>Generally, there is a cost of switching between operating modes (for example, switching from the &quot;not yet invested&quot; state into the
&quot;operational&quot; state incurs the cost of the initial capital investment, 'CAPEX'). The costs incurred in temporarily suspending,
resuming, or abandoning a project could be attributed to firing/hiring project employees, loss in perishable products and general cost
of moving a project into a 'suspended' state. Operational expenditures of a suspended project could include maintenance to inactive
machinery, preventing weathering of project sites, ongoing rent or utility payments, etc. Finally, the abandonment expenditure could
be negative, representing a 'scrap' value of the project that is returned as project assets are sold on abandonment of the project.
</p>
<p>Solving for the value of an investment project with operational flexibility is classified as an optimal switching or optimal control
model. The objective is to optimize the value of the project by taking the optimal set of decisions for the project operating mode
at each time point under uncertainty.
</p>
<p>The 'LSM_real_option_OF' function solves for the optimal switching problem at each discrete time point throughout the backward induction
process. For each operating mode, the immediate payoff of switching to a different operating mode is compared against the discounted 'continuation' value
of staying in the current operating mode. These continuation values are directly estimated through least-squares regression of all simulated price paths (rather than just 'in-the-money' price paths, as is
considered in the value of the option to delay the initial investment decision).
</p>
<p>The 'ROV' value of the investment project is then calculated by considering the option to invest into the 'operational' state. Investment into the project is optimal when the value of the 'operational' state is
greater than the expected continuation value.
</p>
<p>The introduction of operational flexibility to the LSM simulation method greatly increases the level of computational complexity and thus the
<code>LSM_real_option_OF</code> function is considerably slower than the <code>LSM_real_option</code> function.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>
# Example: Value a capital investment project where the revenues follow a
# Geometric Brownian Motion stochastic process:

## Step 1 - Simulate asset prices:
asset_prices &lt;- GBM_simulate(n = 100, t = 10, mu = 0.05,
                         sigma = 0.2, S0 = 100, dt = 1/2)

## Step 2 - Perform Real Option Analysis (ROA):
ROA &lt;- LSM_real_option_OF(state_variables = asset_prices,
                     NCF = asset_prices - 100,
                     CAPEX = 1000,
                     dt = 1/2,
                     rf = 0.05,
                     suspend_CAPEX = 100,
                     suspend_OPEX = 10,
                     resume_CAPEX = 100,
                     abandon_CAPEX = 0
                     )
