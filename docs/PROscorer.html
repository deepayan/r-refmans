<td>An extensible repository of accurate, up-to-date functions to
    score commonly used patient-reported outcome (PRO), quality of life
    (QOL), and other psychometric and psychological measures.
    'PROscorer', together with the 'PROscorerTools' package, is a system
    to facilitate the incorporation of PRO measures into research studies
    and clinical settings in a scientifically rigorous and reproducible
    manner.  These packages and their vignettes are intended to help
    establish and promote best practices for scoring PRO and PRO-like 
    measures in research.  The 'PROscorer' Instrument Descriptions vignette 
    contains descriptions of each instrument scored by 'PROscorer', complete 
    with references.  These instrument descriptions are suitable for inclusion 
    in formal study protocol documents, grant proposals, and manuscript Method
    sections.  Each 'PROscorer' function is composed of helper functions
    from the 'PROscorerTools' package, and users are encouraged to
    contribute new functions to 'PROscorer'.  More scoring functions are
    currently in development and will be added in future updates.</td>

</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function returns the 6 subscale scores and the FSFI Total score (Rosen
et al., 2000), as well as an indicator variable flagging respondents with FSFI
Total scores suggestive of clinically significant levels of sexual
dysfunction (i.e., <code>fsfi_tot &lt;= 26.55</code>; Wiegel et al., 2005).
</p>
<p>The FSFI is intended to measure the sexual function of recently sexually
active women (Rosen et al., 2000), and strong evidence suggests it may not be
a valid measure of sexual function in women with little or no recent sexual
activity (e.g., see Baser et al., 2012).
</p>
<p>As such the <code>fsfi</code> function also returns two variables
(<code>fsfi_nzero15</code> and <code>fsfi_sexactive01</code>) that can be used to
evaluate whether respondents have been sufficiently sexually active for the
FSFI to be a valid assessment of their sexual function.  These variables are
based on the fact that 15 of the 19 FSFI items have a response option of &quot;no
sexual activity&quot; or &quot;did not attempt intercourse&quot;, which corresponds to an
item score of <code>0</code>.  Specifically, the <code>fsfi_nzero15</code> variable
contains the number of items with responses of <code>0</code> or <code>NA</code> (out of
those 15 items that have a response option indicating &quot;no sexual activity&quot;).
Missing responses (i.e., <code>NA</code>) are included in this count because
respondents with no relevant sexual activity often skip these items.  The
<code>fsfi_sexactive01</code> variable is a rough indicator that a respondent was
sufficiently sexually active for the FSFI to be a valid assessment of their
sexual function.  It is a dummy variable that is <code>1</code> when
<code>fsfi_nzero15 &lt;= 7</code> (i.e., when the respondent said &quot;no sexual activity&quot;
to 7 or fewer of the 15 items with that option), and <code>0</code> otherwise.  See
Baser et al. (2012) for more details on how this cutoff was chosen.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A data frame with the following variables is returned:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><strong>fsfi_des</strong> - FSFI Desire subscale (range 1.2 - 6)
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>fsfi_arous</strong> - FSFI Arousal subscale (range 0 - 6)
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>fsfi_lub</strong> - FSFI Lubrication subscale (range 0 - 6)
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>fsfi_org</strong> - FSFI Orgasm subscale (range 0 - 6)
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>fsfi_sat</strong> - FSFI Satisfaction subscale (range 0.8 - 6)
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>fsfi_pain</strong> - FSFI Pain subscale (range 0 - 6)
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>fsfi_tot</strong> - FSFI Total score (range 2 - 36)
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>fsfi_dys01</strong> - Indicator of FSFI sexual dysfunction (i.e., of
<code>fsfi_tot &lt;= 26.55</code>); <code>0</code> = No Dysfunction, <code>1</code> =
Dysfunction
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>fsfi_nzero15</strong> - There are 15 FSFI items that have a response
option of <code>0</code> (&quot;No sexual activity&quot;).  This is the number of those
items with responses of <code>0</code> or <code>NA</code> (See Details).
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>fsfi_sexactive01</strong> - For the FSFI scores to be valid estimates
of sexual functioning, respondents need to have been sexually active
during the 4 week recall period.  This variable indicates whether their
sexual activity levels were high enough for their FSFI scores to be
valid.  Specifically, it is an indicator that <code>fsfi_nzero15 &lt;= 7</code> (See
Details).
</p>
</li></ul>

<p>Optionally, the data frame can additionally have variables containing the
number of valid item responses on each scale for each respondent (if
<code>keepNvalid = TRUE</code>, but this option might be removed in future package
updates).
</p>


<h3>How Missing Data is Handled</h3>

<p>The FSFI authors do not indicate how to handle missing item data when
calculating the FSFI scores.  This is unfortunate because women frequently
skip items they feel are not relevant to them (e.g., the items asking about
satisfaction with &quot;your partner&quot; are often skipped by non-partnered women),
leading to an unexpectedly large number of missing subscale and FSFI total
scores.  To minimize excessive missing values for the FSFI subscale and Total
scores, the <code>fsfi</code> function handles missing items similarly to the
scoring methods for many other PROs.  Specifically, the <code>fsfi</code> function
will calculate the 6 subscale scores as long as at least half of the items on
the given subscale have valid, non-missing item responses.  More concretely,
each subscale must have at least 2 non-missing responses, except for Desire,
which has only 2 items and requires only 1 non-missing response.  The
<code>fsfi</code> function will calculate the FSFI Total Score for a respondent as
long as it was able to calculate at least 5 out of the 6 subscale scores.
Scores calculated in the presence of missing items are pro-rated so that
their theoretical minimum and maximum values are identical those from scores
calculated from complete data.
</p>
<p>These methods of handling missing item responses were chosen to balance the
reality that respondents often skip some items with the need to maintain the
validity of the scores.  However, I know of no directly applicable empirical
study that supports these choices, and I encourage more research into how
missing responses affect the psychometrics of this and other instruments.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>The six FSFI subscale scores are scaled to have a maximum score of 6.0.
The subscale scores are summed to calculate the FSFI Total score, which has
a maximum score of 36.  Because 4 items have no response option scored
<code>0</code> (2 items from Desire subscale and 2 from Satisfaction subscale),
the minimum possible score for the Desire subscale, the Satisfaction
subscale, and the FSFI Total score is greater than zero.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The CC scale originally contained 10 items (Hay et al., 2014).  Later,
evidence that 3 of the items might be measurement non-invariant across
important subgroups led to the recommendation to omit these 3 items and score
a 7-item version of the CC scale (Baser et al., 2016).  When <code>whichScale
= "CC"</code> the <code>narcc</code> function will accept and score either 7 or 10
CC items, although the 7-item version is recommended.  The NAR scale has 6
items, and the <code>narcc</code> function will accept only 6 NAR items when
<code>whichScale = "NAR"</code>.
</p>
<p>If you want to score both the CC and NAR scales, then you need to run the
<code>narcc</code> function twice, once for CC and again for NAR.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A data frame containing a variable containing the scored scale, named either
<code>"CC"</code> or <code>"NAR"</code>.  Scores are scales to have range 0 to 100.
</p>
<p>Optionally, the data frame can additionally have a variable containing the
number of valid item responses on the scale for each respondent (if
<code>keepNvalid = TRUE</code>, but this option might be removed in future package
updates).
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>The <code>narcc</code> function assumes that your item data are numerically
coded from 0 to 3 (i.e., with 0 = &quot;Strongly Disagree&quot; and 3 = &quot;Strongly
Agree&quot;).  However, your item data might instead be coded from 1 to 4.  If
this is the case, you MUST let the <code>narcc</code> function know this by
using the <code>minmax</code> argument, specifically, <code>minmax = c(1, 4)</code>.

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>An open-source repository of functions to score specific
Patient-Reported Outcome (PRO), Quality of Life (QoL), and other
psychometric measures commonly used in research.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The <span class="pkg">PROscorer</span> package is an extensible repository of functions
to score specific PRO, QoL, and other psychometric measures and
questionnaire-based instruments commonly used in research.  It is intended
to promote best practices for scoring PRO-like instruments, to standardize
scoring procedures for PRO measures across studies, and to improve the
reproducibility of research with PRO-like instruments by providing
accurate, up-to-date, and well-documented PRO scoring functions that can
easily be integrated into scientifically reproducible workflows.
</p>
<p>Additionally, <span class="pkg">PROscorer</span> is accompanied by a package vignette that
contains detailed descriptions of each instrument scored by
<span class="pkg">PROscorer</span>, complete with references.  Importantly, the instrument
summaries are written according to a set of standards that ensure they meet
&quot;best practice&quot; guidelines for descriptions of PRO-like measures in formal
research protocols and in reports of research results featuring such
measures.  This means that, with little or no editing, a given instrument
summary can be copied and pasted directly into protocols, grant proposals,
and manuscripts.  In addition to improving the measure descriptions in
research documents, this saves the study investigators considerable time
and effort.
</p>


<h3>The Problem</h3>

<p>The scientific rigor and reproducibility of research
involving PRO, QoL, and similar measures is lagging behind other research
areas.  Three major reasons for these shortcomings are (1) measurement
error introduced by faulty scoring procedures, (2) inconsistent application
of scoring instructions across different studies using the same PRO
measures, and (3) inadequate, incomplete, and/or inaccurate descriptions of
PRO-like measures in research protocols and in published results of studies
that incorporate such measures.
</p>
<p>Scoring procedures represent a major source of error in research studies
that rely upon PRO and similar measures.  These errors typically go
unnoticed, hidden, and/or ignored, eroding the scientific integrity of the
research and hindering progress in the numerous scientific fields that
conduct studies that use these measures.
</p>
<p>Similarly, inconsistent application of PRO scoring procedures and
variation in scoring across studies makes study results less likely to
replicate and slows the accumulation of reliable scientific data from the
PRO measure.
</p>
<p>Inadequate, incomplete, and/or inaccurate descriptions of PRO-like measures
in research documents can cause confusion and introduce errors, oversights,
and other mistakes at multiple stages in the research process.
</p>


<h3>The Proposed Solution</h3>

<p>The <span class="pkg">PROscorer</span> package provides the
framework for addressing these problems with research involving PRO-like
measures.  The lofty goal of the <span class="pkg">PROscorer</span> package is to eliminate
these serious deficiencies in PRO-based research by serving as the
gold-standard open-source repository of scoring syntax and instrument
descriptions for PRO-like measures commonly used in research and clinical
settings.
</p>
<p>The features of the <span class="pkg">PROscorer</span> package and supporting infrastructure
were carefully planned with this ambitious goal in mind.
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><span class="pkg">PROscorer</span> serves as the repository of scoring functions for
specific, commonly-used PRO measures (e.g., the EORTC QLQ-C30).
</p>
</li>
<li><p> All scoring functions in <span class="pkg">PROscorer</span> are written using simpler
functions from a separate package, <span class="pkg">PROscorerTools</span>.  The
<span class="pkg">PROscorerTools</span> package provides the well-tested, reusable
infrastructure for the <span class="pkg">PROscorer</span> functions.  This makes it easy to
write new scoring functions to add to <span class="pkg">PROscorer</span>, and decreases the
chance of errors and other bugs.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Advanced users can use <span class="pkg">PROscorerTools</span> to write new scoring
functions for their favorite PRO-like measures and submit them for
inclusion in future <span class="pkg">PROscorer</span> updates.  As of this initial release,
the system for writing and submitting new functions is immature.  A
vignette will be included in future updates with a guide for writing new
functions and submitting them for review on GitHub.
</p>
</li></ul>

<p>Functions to score additional PRO measures are currently under development
and will be included in future releases.
</p>


<h3>Please Provide Feedback</h3>

<p>The <span class="pkg">PROscorer</span> and
<span class="pkg">PROscorerTools</span> packages are still in their initial versions.  As
such, some details and other conventions are still being hammered out,
particularly in <span class="pkg">PROscorerTools</span> (e.g., function naming conventions,
argument-checking functions, etc.).  However, any changes to the
<span class="pkg">PROscorer</span> functions are expected to be internal and have little or no
impact on end-users.
</p>
<p>I put a lot of thought into the <span class="pkg">PROscorer</span> and <span class="pkg">PROscorerTools</span>
packages, and I have tested them as an end-user as well as developer.
However, I cannot anticipate the needs of all users, and I would like your
feedback on your experience using the package(s).  Please let me know if
you found <span class="pkg">PROscorer</span> and/or <span class="pkg">PROscorerTools</span> helpful.  And please
tell me how I can improve their usability, and definitely report any bugs
or other unexpected behaviors you encounter.  Make feature requests and bug
reports here: https://github.com/raybaser/PROscorerTools/issues

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function returns a total of 7 different scores from the EORTC
QLQ-BLM30. Scores are calculated according to the official scoring algorithms
from the EORTC.
</p>
<p>In addition to the name of your data frame containing the QLQ-BLM30 item
responses (<code>df</code>), you need to tell the function how to find the
variables that correspond to the QLQ-BLM30 items in <code>df</code>.  You can do this
in 1 of 2 ways:
</p>

<ol>
<li><p> The first way is to manually provide the item names or locations
using the <code>items</code> argument.  For example, if your first 10
variables in <code>df</code> contain demographics, followed by the 30 QLQ-BLM30
items <strong>in order</strong> starting with the 11th variable, then you could
use <code>items = 11:40</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The second way only applies if your data frame (<code>df</code>) contains
<strong>ONLY</strong> the 30 variables corresponding to the 30 QLQ-BLM30 items,
in order, with no other non-QLQ-BLM30 variables.  In this case, you can
just use the <code>df</code> argument and omit <code>items</code>.
</p>
</li></ol>



<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A data frame with all 7 of the QLQ-BLM30 scores is returned.  Of the 7
scores, there are 5 multi-item Symptom Scales, 1 single-item Symptom Scale
(Catheter Use Problems), and 1 multi-item Functional Scale (Sexual
Functioning) (see below).  All scores are scaled to range from 0-100, even
scores based on single items.  Be aware that these single-item scales still
have only 4 possible values, even though they are transformed to range from
0-100.  The scale names and numbers of items are listed below.
</p>
<p><strong>Symptom Scales (higher is more symptoms, worse functioning)</strong>
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><strong>BLM_US</strong> - Urinary Symptoms (from 7 items)
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>BLM_UP</strong> - Urostomy Problems (from 6 items)
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>BLM_FU</strong> - Future Perspective (from 3 items)
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>BLM_BAF</strong> - Abdominal Bloating and Flatulence (from 2 items)
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>BLM_BI</strong> - Body Image (from 3 items)
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>BLM_CU</strong> - Catheter Use Problems (from 1 item)
</p>
</li></ul>

<p><strong>Functional Scales (higher is better functioning)</strong>
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><strong>BLM_SX</strong> - Sexual Functioning (from 2, 4, 6, or 7 items,
depending on the respondent)
</p>
</li></ul>

<p>Optionally, the data frame can additionally have variables containing the
number of valid item responses on each scale for each respondent (if
<code>keepNvalid = TRUE</code>, but this option might be removed in future package
updates).
</p>


<h3>How Missing Data is Handled</h3>

<p>For all scale scores <strong>except for the Sexual Functioning scale</strong>, the
<code>qlq_blm30</code> function will calculate the scale scores as long as at
least half of the items on the given scale have valid, non-missing item
responses.  Scores calculated in the presence of missing items are
pro-rated so that their theoretical minimum and maximum values are
identical to those from scores calculated from complete data.
</p>
<p>The Sexual Functioning scale is handled differently because it has several
conditional questions that may not be applicable to a given patient (i.e.,
some questions apply only to men or only to women, and some questions apply
only to sexually active respondents).  As a result, the Sexual Functioning
scale may have 2, 4, 6, or 7 questions applicable for a given respondent.
Because the minimum number of applicable items is 2, the <code>qlq_blm30</code>
function will calculate the  Sexual Functioning scale score as long as at
least 1 of the items has a valid, non-missing response.  Note that this can
result in the <code>qlq_blm30</code> function scoring the Sexual Functioning
scale for some respondents when they should technically be assigned a
missing value for the scale.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function returns a total of 16 different scores from the EORTC QLQ-C30
(Aaronson et al., 1993), including the new QLQ-C30 Summary Score (Giesinger
et al, 2016).  Scores are calculated according to the official scoring
algorithms in the EORTC QLQ-C30 Scoring Manual (Fayers et al, 2001).
</p>
<p>In addition to the name of your data frame containing the QLQ-C30 item
responses (<code>df</code>), you need to tell the function how to find the
variables that correspond to the QLQ-C30 items in <code>df</code>.  You can do this
in 1 of 3 different ways:
</p>

<ol>
<li><p> The easiest way is to use the <code>iprefix</code> argument.  This
assumes that your items are named using a consistent prefix,
followed by the item number (e.g., 'q1', 'q2', 'q3', etc.).  In this
case, you could use <code>iprefix = 'q'</code>, and the function will know to
look for items named 'q1' to 'q30' in your data (<code>df</code>).  Note that
this method will <strong>NOT</strong> work if your items are numbered with
leading zeros for single digit item numbers (e.g., 'q01', 'q02', etc.).
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The second way is to manually provide the item names or locations
using the <code>items</code> argument.  For example, if your first 10
variables in <code>df</code> contain demographics, followed by the 30 QLQ-C30
items <strong>in order</strong> starting with the 11th variable, then you could
use <code>items = 11:40</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The last way only applies if your data frame (<code>df</code>) contains
<strong>ONLY</strong> the 30 variables corresponding to the 30 QLQ-C30 items,
in order, with no other non-QLQ-C30 variables.  In this case, you can
just use the <code>df</code> argument and omit <code>iprefix</code> and
<code>items</code>.
</p>
</li></ol>

<p>You can use EITHER the <code>iprefix</code> or <code>items</code> argument, or NEITHER of
them (in the case of #3 above).  <strong>But you cannot use both.</strong>
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A data frame with all of the QLQ-C30 scores is returned.  All scores
are scaled to range from 0-100, even scores based on single items.  Be
aware that these single-item scales still have only 4 possible values, even
though they are transformed to range from 0-100.  The scale names and numbers
of items are listed below.
</p>
<p><strong>Global health status/QoL</strong>
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><strong>QL</strong> - Global health status/QoL (revised) (from 2 items)
</p>
</li></ul>

<p><strong>Functional Scales (higher is better functioning)</strong>
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><strong>PF</strong> - Physical functioning (from 5 items)
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>RF</strong> - Role functioning (from 2 items)
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>EF</strong> - Emotional functioning (from 4 items)
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>CF</strong> - Cognitive functioning (from 2 items)
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>SF</strong> - Social functioning (from 2 items)
</p>
</li></ul>

<p><strong>Symptom Scales (higher is more symptoms, worse functioning)</strong>
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><strong>FA</strong> - Fatigue (from 3 items)
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>NV</strong> - Nausea and Vomiting (from 2 items)
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>PA</strong> - Pain (from 2 items)
</p>
</li></ul>

<p><strong>Single-Item Symptom Scores (higher is more symptoms, worse functioning)</strong>
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><strong>DY</strong> - Dyspnoea
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>SL</strong> - Insomnia
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>AP</strong> - Appetite Loss
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>CO</strong> - Constipation
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>DI</strong> - Diarrhoea
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>FI</strong> - Financial Difficulties
</p>
</li></ul>

<p><strong>QLQ-C30 Summary Score (higher is better functioning, fewer symptoms)</strong>
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><strong>C30SUMMARY</strong> - QLQ-C30 Summary Score, composed by taking mean
of all scores except for QL (Global health status/QoL) and FI (Financial
Difficulties)
</p>
</li></ul>

<p>Optionally, the data frame can additionally have variables containing the
number of valid item responses on each scale for each respondent (if
<code>keepNvalid = TRUE</code>, but this option might be removed in future package
updates).
</p>


<h3>How Missing Data is Handled</h3>

<p>The <code>qlq_c30</code> function will calculate the scale scores as long as at
least half of the items on the given scale have valid, non-missing item
responses.  The <code>qlq_c30</code> function will calculate the QLQ-C30 Summary
Score (<code>C30SUMMARY</code>) for a respondent only if all 13 scales contributing to
that score are non-missing.  Scores calculated in the presence of missing
items are pro-rated so that their theoretical minimum and maximum values
are identical to those from scores calculated from complete data.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>This function follows the scoring algorithm in the official EORTC QLQ-C30 Scoring
Manual (Fayers et al, 2001) exactly, with two exceptions.
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><strong>QLQ-C30 Summary Score</strong> - The QLQ-C30 Summary Score
<code>C30SUMMARY</code> was developed after the EORTC QLQ-C30 Scoring Manual
was published.  This summary scale was scored according to instructions
on the EORTC website (http://groups.eortc.be/qol/manuals).
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>Scale Score Names</strong> - The QLQ-C30 Scoring Manual names the
Global Health Status/QoL scale, the Physical Functioning scale, and the
Role Functioning scale 'QL2', 'PF2', and 'RF2', respectively, to indicate
that these are revised versions of these scales.  However, this clashes
with the naming convention that many statisticians use for longitudinal
assessments (e.g., where 'QL2' would be used to indicate the second 'QL'
assessment).  As such, this function drops the '2' suffix from these
scale names.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function returns a total of 12 different scores from the EORTC
QLQ-CR38. The scoring instructions for the QLQ-CR38 are no longer available
from the EORTC, and the QLQ-CR38 seems to have been superseded by the
QLQ-CR29.  This function calculates the QLQ-CR38 scores based on an old SPSS
syntax file from the EORTC, and from Sprangers et al. (1999).
</p>
<p>In addition to the name of your data frame containing the QLQ-CR38 item

</p>
</li></ol>



<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A data frame with all 12 of the QLQ-CR38 scores is returned.  Of the 12
scores, 4 are Functional Scales and 8 are Symptom Scales (see below).  Of the
8 Symptom Scales, 1 is based on a single item and 7 are multi-item scales.
Of the 4 Functional Scales, 2 are multi-item and 2 are based on single items.
All scores are scaled to range from 0-100, even scores based on single items.
Be aware that these single-item scales still have only 4 possible values,
even though they are transformed to range from 0-100.  The scale names and

<h3>How Missing Data is Handled</h3>

<p>The <code>qlq_cr38</code> function will calculate the scale scores as long as at

responses.  Scores calculated in the presence of missing
items are pro-rated so that their theoretical minimum and maximum values
are identical to those from scores calculated from complete data.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>Some of the QLQ-CR38 items/scales are not applicable to all patients.  There
are 2 questions for men only, 2 questions for women only, 7 questions only
for patients WITHOUT a stoma (colostomy bag), and 7 questions only for
patients WITH a stoma.  Patients will therefore have missing values for some
of the scale scores.

<p>Optionally, the data frame can additionally have variables containing the
number of valid item responses on each scale for each respondent (if
<code>keepNvalid = TRUE</code>, but this option might be removed in future package
updates).
</p>


<h3>How Missing Data is Handled</h3>

<p>The <code>qlq_cx24</code> function will calculate the scale scores as long as at
least half of the items on the given scale have valid, non-missing item
responses.  Scores calculated in the presence of missing
items are pro-rated so that their theoretical minimum and maximum values
are identical to those from scores calculated from complete data.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>Note that the QLQ-CX24 instructs respondents to
answer the last 5 questions on the instrument <strong>only</strong> if they have been
sexually active during the past 4 weeks.  These 5 items include all 4 items on
the Sexual/Vaginal Functioning symptom scale and the 1 item on the Sexual
Enjoyment functional scale.  Because of this, when the QLQ-CX24 is scored
correctly, <strong>it is normal for a large number of respondents to have</strong>
<strong>missing values for the Sexual/Vaginal Functioning and Sexual Enjoyment</strong>
<strong>scores</strong>.  This is due to those respondents skipping those questions
because they were not sexually active during the 4 weeks before completing
the questionnaire.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>qlq_pan26(df, items = NULL, keepNvalid = FALSE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr><td><code id="qlq_pan26_+3A_df">df</code></td>
<td>
<p>A data frame containing responses to the 26 QLQ-PAN26 items, and
possibly other variables.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="qlq_pan26_+3A_items">items</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character vector with the QLQ-PAN26 item names, or a numeric
vector indicating the column numbers of the QLQ-PAN26 items in <code>df</code>.
If <code>items</code> is omitted, then <code>qlq_PAN26</code> will assume that
<code>df</code> contains <strong>ONLY</strong> the QLQ-PAN26 items and no other variables.
See Details for more information.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="qlq_pan26_+3A_keepnvalid">keepNvalid</code></td>
<td>
<p>Logical, whether to return variables containing the
number of valid, non-missing items on each scale for each respondent should
be returned in the data frame with the scale scores.  The default is
<code>FALSE</code>.  Set to <code>TRUE</code> to return these variables, which will be
named <code>"scalename_N"</code> (e.g., <code>QL_N</code>).  Most users should omit
this argument entirely.  This argument might be removed from future
versions of the package, so please let me know if you think this argument
useful and would rather it remain a part of the function.</p>

</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function returns a total of 17 different scores from the EORTC
QLQ-PAN26. Scores are calculated according to the official scoring algorithms
from the EORTC.  At the time this scoring function was written (April 2022),
the QLQ-PAN26 had completed Phase 3 testing; however, the official scoring
instructions from the EORTC warned that this scaling structure is still
preliminary and may change in the future.
</p>
<p>In addition to the name of your data frame containing the QLQ-PAN26 item
responses (<code>df</code>), you need to tell the function how to find the
variables that correspond to the QLQ-PAN26 items in <code>df</code>.  You can do this
in 1 of 2 ways:
</p>

<ol>
<li><p> The first way is to manually provide the item names or locations
using the <code>items</code> argument.  For example, if your first 10
variables in <code>df</code> contain demographics, followed by the 26 QLQ-PAN26
items <strong>in order</strong> starting with the 11th variable, then you could
use <code>items = 11:36</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The second way only applies if your data frame (<code>df</code>) contains
<strong>ONLY</strong> the 26 variables corresponding to the 26 QLQ-PAN26 items,
in order, with no other non-QLQ-PAN26 variables.  In this case, you can
just use the <code>df</code> argument and omit <code>items</code>.
</p>
</li></ol>



<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A data frame with all 17 of the QLQ-PAN26 scores is returned.  Of the 17
scores, 15 are Symptom Scales and 2 are Functional Scales (see below).  Of
the 15 Symptom Scales, 10 are based on a single item each.  All scores are
scaled to range from 0-100, even scores based on single items.  Be aware that
these single-item scales still have only 4 possible values, even though they
are transformed to range from 0-100.  The scale names and numbers of items are
listed below.
</p>
<p><strong>Symptom Scales (higher is more symptoms, worse functioning)</strong>
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><strong>PAN_PP</strong> - Pancreatic pain (from 4 items)
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>PAN_BF</strong> - Bloating (from 1 item)
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>PAN_DS</strong> - Digestive symptoms (from 2 items)
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>PAN_TA</strong> - Taste (from 1 item)
</p>
</li>

</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>PAN_PL</strong> - Planning of activities (from 1 item)
</p>
</li></ul>

<p><strong>Functional Scales (higher is better functioning)</strong>
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><strong>PAN_SA</strong> - Satisfaction with health care (from 2 items)
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>PAN_SX</strong> - Sexuality (from 2 items)
</p>
</li></ul>

<p>Optionally, the data frame can additionally have variables containing the
number of valid item responses on each scale for each respondent (if
<code>keepNvalid = TRUE</code>, but this option might be removed in future package
updates).
</p>


<h3>How Missing Data is Handled</h3>

<p>The <code>qlq_PAN26</code> function will calculate the scale scores as long as at
least half of the items on the given scale have valid, non-missing item
responses.  Scores calculated in the presence of missing
items are pro-rated so that their theoretical minimum and maximum values
are identical to those from scores calculated from complete data.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p><strong>As of April 15, 2022, there is an error in the official PAN26 scoring
instructions from the EORTC.</strong>
The first page of the official PAN26 scoring instructions from the EORTC
indicates that the two items comprising the SA (Satisfaction with health
care) functional scale should be reverse scored.  In the instructions, these
two items are numbered as 53 and 54.  However, the second page of the
instructions indicates items 55 and 56 should be reversed (see bullet, &quot;(1)
Raw score&quot; in the &quot;Principle for scoring&quot; subsection).  Items 55 and 56
comprise the SX (Sexuality) functional scale.
<strong>The items that need to be reversed are the SX items (55 and 56), NOT
the SA items (not 53 and 54).</strong>  This function correctly reverses the SX items
instead of the SA items.
