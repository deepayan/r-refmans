Package to Create a MIP Based Array
</h2><span id='topic+DoE.MIParray-package'></span><span id='topic+DoE.MIParray'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>'CRAN' packages 'DoE.base' and 'Rmosek' and non-'CRAN' package 'gurobi' are enhanced with functionality for the creation of optimized arrays for experimentation, where optimization is in terms of generalized minimum aberration. It is also possible to optimally extend existing arrays to larger run size. The package writes 'MPS' (Mathematical Programming System) files for use with any mixed integer optimization software that can process such files. If at least one of the commercial products 'Gurobi' or 'Mosek' (free academic licenses available for both) is available, the package also creates arrays by optimization. For installing 'Gurobi' and its R package 'gurobi', follow instructions at &lt;https://www.gurobi.com/products/gurobi-optimizer/&gt; and &lt;https://www.gurobi.com/documentation/7.5/refman/r_api_overview.html&gt; (or higher version). For installing 'Mosek' and its R package 'Rmosek', follow instructions at &lt;https://www.mosek.com/downloads/&gt; and &lt;https://docs.mosek.com/8.1/rmosek/install-interface.html&gt;, or use the functionality in the stump CRAN R package 'Rmosek'.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The package creates an array with specified minimum resolution and optimized word length pattern, using mixed integer programming (MIP). This is a step in
generalized minimum aberration (GMA) according to Xu and Wu (2001), which is a way to minimize the confounding potential in a factorial design, as measured by the generalized word length pattern (GWLP). Reduction of short words has priority over reduction of long words, because it pertains to confounding of lower order interactions, which is assumed to be more severe than confounding of higher order interactions.
</p>
<p>There is always one word of length zero. An array is said to have strength t (resolution R=t+1), if it has no words of lengths 1,...,t, but has words of length R=t+1; in that case, t-factor interactions are not confounded with the overall mean, (t-1)-factor interactions are not confounded with main effects, and so forth. Groemping and Xu (2014) provided an interpretation of the number of shortest words (i.e. words of length R) in terms of coefficients of determination of linear models with main effects model matrix columns on the LHS and full factorial t-factor models on the right-hand side; for example, in an array of strength 2 with three 3-level factors, the number of words of length 3 is the sum of the two R^2 values obtained from regressing the two main effects model matrix columns of one of the factors on a full model in the other two factors, provided main effect model matrix columns are coded orthogonally (to each other and the overall mean). GMA considers a design better than another one, if it has larger strength or resolution. In case of ties, a design is better if it has fewer shortest words; further ties are resolved by comparing words of lengths t+2, t+3, ...
</p>
<p>Any array found by a function of this package will have the requested resolution (if not possible, an error will be thrown). If desired (default, but can be suppressed), optimization of the number of shortest words will be attempted. If <code>kmax</code> is chosen larger than the resolution, optimization of longer words will also be attempted. Mixed integer optimization is very resource-intensive and often fails to provide a confirmed optimum (see also below). Choosing <code>kmax</code> larger than the resolution is therefore advisable for very small problems only; in most cases, one should attempt an optimization of the number of shortest words only, or even suppress that by <code>find.only=TRUE</code>. Only after this has been achieved, possibly with several sequential attempts, a subsequent attempt to improve the number of longer words should be undertaken.
</p>
<p>Functions <code><a href="#topic+gurobi_MIParray">gurobi_MIParray</a></code> and <code><a href="#topic+mosek_MIParray">mosek_MIParray</a></code> create an array from scratch (<code>start=NULL</code> and <code>forced=NULL</code>), by trying to improve a starting array specified with the argument <code>start</code>, or by restricting a portion of the array to correspond to a pre-existing array with the argument <code>forced</code>. If no starting array is given, the functions initially obtain one by solving a linear optimization problem for obtaining a design with the requested resolution. Subsequently, the number of shortest words of the starting array is optimized, followed by the numbers of words of length up to <code>kmax</code>.
</p>
<p>Where functions <code><a href="#topic+gurobi_MIParray">gurobi_MIParray</a></code> and <code><a href="#topic+mosek_MIParray">mosek_MIParray</a></code> do not easily find an optimal array, it may be worthwhile to consider using functions <code><a href="#topic+gurobi_MIPsearch">gurobi_MIPsearch</a></code> and <code><a href="#topic+mosek_MIPsearch">mosek_MIPsearch</a></code>, which can search over different orderings of the factor levels; these have been provided because a brief search for a fortunate level orderings may be successful where a very long search for an unfortunate level ordering fails.
</p>
<p>The algorithm implemented in the package is explained in Groemping and Fontana (2019); it is a modification of Fontana (2017). Modifications include enforcing the requested resolution via a linear optimization step (much faster than sequentially optimizing all those word lengths until they are zeroes), and using a result on coding invariance from Groemping (2018) for a more parsimonious formulation of constraints. Mixed integer programming can use a lot of time and resources; in particular, the confirmation of the optimality of a solution that has been found can take prohibitively long, even if the optimal solution itself has been found fast (which is also not necessarily so). Functions <code><a href="#topic+gurobi_MIPcontinue">gurobi_MIPcontinue</a></code> and <code><a href="#topic+mosek_MIPcontinue">mosek_MIPcontinue</a></code> can be used to continue optimization for larger problems,
where optimization was previously aborted, e.g. due to a time limit (however, a lot of effort is lost and has to be repeated when continuing a previous attempt). Note that it is possible to continue an optimization effort started with Gurobi using Mosek and vice versa, because the functions <code>gurobi_MIPcontinue</code> and <code>mosek_MIPcontinue</code> can convert problems using the internal functions <code><a href="#topic+mosek2gurobi">mosek2gurobi</a></code> and <code><a href="#topic+gurobi2mosek">gurobi2mosek</a></code>. Groemping (2020) explains the package itself.
</p>
<p>The solver functions in the package use the commercial solvers Mosek and/or Gurobi, which provide free academic licenses. These solvers and their corresponding vendor-provided R packages have to be installed for using the package's solver functions. For users who do not have access to these but to other solvers, the package provides export functions to mps files that can be read by other solvers, for example by IBM CPLEX (<code><a href="#topic+write_MPSMIQP">write_MPSMIQP</a></code>, <code><a href="#topic+write_MPSILPlist">write_MPSILPlist</a></code>).
</p>


<h3>Warning</h3>

<p>Escaping from a Gurobi run will most likely be unsuccessful, might leave R in an unstable state, and usually fails to release the entire CPU usage; thus, one should think carefully about the affordable run times. <br />
Mosek can usually be escaped using the &lt;ESC&gt; key, and one can even hope to get a valid output.
However, after such escapes, it is also advisable to use <span class="pkg">RMosek</span>'s internal clean function
(<code>Rmosek:::mosek_clean()</code>), since computer instabilities after repeated escapes from Mosek have been observed
(the package functions execute the <code>mosek_clean</code> command after conducting Mosek runs).
</p>


<h3>Installation</h3>

<p>Gurobi and Mosek need to be separately installed; please follow vendors' instructions; it is necessary to obtain a license; for academic use, free academic licenses are available in both cases.
</p>
<p>Both Gurobi and Mosek provide R packages (<span class="pkg">gurobi</span> and <span class="pkg">Rmosek</span>) for accessing the software, and they also provide instructions on their installation.
</p>
<p>For Gurobi, the R package <span class="pkg">gurobi</span> is provided with the software installation files and can simply be installed like usual for a non-Web package.
</p>
<p>For Mosek, there is a CRAN package <span class="pkg">Rmosek</span>, which is a stump only and can be used for installing the suitable package <span class="pkg">Rmosek</span> from the Mosek website.
Its installation requires compilation from source.  Several prerequisites are needed, basically the same ones needed for compiling packages.
Make sure to set up the R environment for this purpose (for Windows, see <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/">https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/</a>; you may have to set some paths yourself;
I am not familiar with the proper process for other platforms).  If this is accomplished and package <span class="pkg">Matrix</span> is at the latest level (as recommended in the <span class="pkg">Rmosek</span>
online documentation), install the CRAN package <span class="pkg">Rmosek</span>, whose purpose it is to support installation of the appropriate <span class="pkg">Rmosek</span> package for your platform and Mosek version.
Once this CRAN package is available, run function <code>mosek_attachbuilder</code>, specifying the appropriate path as
pointed out in the function's documentation, and subsequently run the custom-made function <code>install.rmosek</code>.  After this activity (if all went well), the CRAN package <span class="pkg">Rmosek</span>
will have been replaced by a working version of package <span class="pkg">Rmosek</span> whose version number depends on your version of Mosek.  In case of problems,
running the <code>install.packages</code> command provided in the <span class="pkg">Rmosek</span> online documentation for your version of Mosek (Mosek ApS 2017b) may also be worth a try;
if all else fails, you may have to contact <span class="pkg">Rmosek</span> support.
</p>
<p>Don't be confused by Mosek ApS's somewhat strange communication regarding the package <span class="pkg">Rmosek</span>: the CRAN version (stump for the purpose of supporting installation of the working version)
has its own separate numbering that currently starts with &ldquo;1&rdquo;. The working <span class="pkg">Rmosek</span> packages have version numbers whose first digit is kept in sync with the Mosek major version number;
apart from that, version numbers of <span class="pkg">Rmosek</span> versions and Mosek versions are not kept in sync; for example, the current version (July 13 2019) of package Rmosek for Mosek
version 8 is 8.0.69, while the Mosek version is 8.1.0.81 (the revision versions of Mosek change quite frequently).  Whenever Mosek itself is re-installed (at least with a change of minor version
like 8.0 to 8.1), the <span class="pkg">Rmosek</span> sources must be re-compiled, even if their version has not changed;
this is presumably why Mosek ApS speak of a version number for the binary that corresponds to the Mosek version number, while the sources keep their version number
(somewhat confusing for the R community).  From within R, version numbers can be queried by <code>packageVersion("Rmosek")</code> and <code>Rmosek::mosek_version()</code>, respectively.</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>The package is not meant for situations, for which a full factorial design would be huge; the mixed integer problem to be solved has at least <code>prod(nlevels)</code> binary or general integer variables and will likely be untractable, if this number is too large. (For extending an existing designs, since some variables are fixed, the limit moves out a bit.)

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>## Not run: 
## ideal sequence of optimization problems
## shown here for Mosek,
## for Gurobi analogous, if necessary increasing maxtime to e.g. 600 or 3600 or ...

## very small problem
plan &lt;- mosek_MIParray(16, rep(2,6), resolution=4, kmax=6)

## an example approach for a larger problem
## optimize shortest word length
plan3 &lt;- mosek_MIParray(24, c(2,4,3,2,2,2,2), resolution=3, maxtime=20)
## feasible solution was found, no confirmed optimum, 7/3 words of length 3
## try to optimize further or confirm optimality (improve=TRUE does this),
##                      give it 10 minutes
plan3b &lt;- mosek_MIPcontinue(plan3, improve=TRUE, maxtime=600)
##     no improvement has been found, and the gap is still very large
##     (the time limit makes the result non-deterministic, of course,
##      because it depends on the computer's power and availability of its resources)

## For large problems, it cannot be expected that a *confirmed* optimum is found.
## Of course, one can put more effort into the optimization, e.g. by running overnight.
## It is also advisable to compare the outcome to other ways for obtaining a good array,
##    e.g. function oa.design from package DoE.base with optimized column allocation.
require(DoE.base)
show.oas(nruns=24, nlevels=c(2,4,3,2,2,2,2), show=Inf)
GWLP(plan_oad &lt;- oa.design(nruns=24, nlevels=c(2,4,3,2,2,2,2), col="min34"))
## here, plan3b has a better A3 than plan_oad

## one might also try to confirm optimality by switching to the other optimizer
plan3c &lt;- gurobi_MIPcontinue(plan3b, improve=TRUE, maxtime=600, MIPFocus=3)
   ## focus on improved bound with option MIPFocus
   ## still same value with very large gap after running this
   ## thus, now assume this as best practically feasible value

## one might now try to improve words of length 4 (improve=FALSE turns to the next word length)
plan4 &lt;- mosek_MIPcontinue(plan3b, improve=FALSE, maxtime=600)
   ## this does not yield any improvement
   ## working on longer words is not considered worthwhile
   ## thus, plan3 or plan3b are used for pragmatic reasons,
   ## without confirmed optimality

## End(Not run)

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The functions do <em>not</em> do any problem solving, they serve the sole purpose of exporting problems so that they can be addressed by solvers other than Mosek or Gurobi. The target solver must be able to process the MPS format.
</p>
<p><code>write_MPSILP</code> writes a single problem to an MPS file. The function is used by function <code><a href="#topic+write_MPSILPlist">write_MPSILPlist</a></code>.
</p>
<p><code>create_MIQP</code> creates a quadratic problem in MPS format, using a general quadratic representation (section <code>Q</code>) for external solvers (default) or Mosek format with conic quadratic constraints (<code>forMosek=TRUE</code>); the function is used by function <code><a href="#topic+write_MPSMIQP">write_MPSMIQP</a></code>.
</p>
<p>The start array for <code>create_MIQP</code> can be made available from a previous linear optimization (though this is not enforced).
If an admissible start array is provided, <code>write_MPSMIQP</code> initially prints the GWLP of that start array.
Otherwise, it warns of inadmissibility. The start value cannot be stored in the MPS file. Instead, for a non-NULL start array,
a separate file (suffix <code>.start</code>) is created, and users have to work out how they can make their solver use that start solution.
Note that the availability of a start array can improve the ability of a solver to find an optimum solution. However, this is not always the case,
there are also instances for which a better solution is found without providing a start solution.
</p>
<p>Note that it can take a long time to write the problems, if the problem has many variables (the number of variables is <code>prod(nlevels)</code>).
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Function <code>create_MIPQ</code> creates a list object of class <code>qco</code>, see also section &quot;Details&quot;.
</p>
<p>Function <code>write_MPSILP</code> does not return a value.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>The functions are not meant for situations, for which a full factorial design would be huge. Even though the functions do not solve anything, MPS files will be very large and writing them will be quite slow for such cases.

Functions to Create a MIP Based Array Using Gurobi or Mosek
</h2><span id='topic+mosek_MIParray'></span><span id='topic+gurobi_MIParray'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The functions create an array with specified minimum resolution and optionally also optimized word length pattern based on mixed integer programming with the commercial software Gurobi (free academic license available) or Mosek (free academic license available).
Creation is done from scratch, or using a user-specified starting value, or extending an existing array. Important: Installation of Gurobi and/of Mosek as well as the corresponding R packages is necessary. The R package gurobi comes with the software, the current version of the R package Rmosek has to be obtained from vendor's website (CRAN version is outdated!).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>mosek_MIParray(nruns, nlevels, resolution = 3, kmax = max(resolution, 2),
   distinct = TRUE, detailed = 0, start=NULL, forced=NULL, find.only = FALSE,
   maxtime = Inf, nthread=2, mosek.opts = list(verbose = 10, soldetail = 1),
   mosek.params = list(dparam = list(LOWER_OBJ_CUT = 0.5, MIO_TOL_ABS_GAP = 0.2,
      INTPNT_CO_TOL_PFEAS = 1e-05, INTPNT_CO_TOL_INFEAS = 1e-07),
      iparam = list(PRESOLVE_LINDEP_USE="OFF", LOG_MIO_FREQ=100)))
gurobi_MIParray(nruns, nlevels, resolution = 3, kmax = max(resolution, 2),
  distinct = TRUE, detailed = 0, start=NULL, forced=NULL, find.only = FALSE,
  maxtime = 60, nthread = 2, heurist=0.5, MIQCPMethod=0, MIPFocus=1,
  gurobi.params = list(BestObjStop = 0.5, LogFile=""))

<p>logical; if TRUE (default), restricts counting vector to 0/1 entries, which means that the resulting array is requested to have distinct rows; otherwise, duplicate rows are permitted, i.e. the counting vector can have arbitrary non-negative integers. Designs with distinct runs are usually better; in addition, binary variables are easier to handle by the optimization algorithm. Nevertheless, there are occasions where a better array is found faster with option <code>distinct=FALSE</code>, even if it has distinct rows.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="mosek_MIParray_+3A_detailed">detailed</code></td>

a starting value for the algorithm: can be a array matrix with entries 1 to number of levels for each column, or a counting vector for the full factorial in lexicographic order; if specified, <code>start</code> must specify an array with the appropriate number of rows and columns, the requested resolution and, if <code>distinct = TRUE</code>, also contain distinct rows (matrix) or 0/1 elements only.
</p>

<code>gurobi.params$TimeLimit</code> or <code>mosek.params$dparam$$MIO_MAX_TIME</code>, the stricter request prevails; the default values differ between Gurobi (60) and Mosek (Inf), because Mosek runs can be easily escaped, while Gurobi runs cannot.

CAUTION: <code>nthread</code> should not be chosen larger than the available number of cores. Gurobi warns that performance will deteriorate, but was observed to perform OK. For Mosek, performance will strongly deteriorate, and for extreme choices the R session might even crash (even for small problems)!

The arguments <code>maxtime</code> and <code>nthread</code> correspond to the <code>dparam$MIO_MAX_TIME</code> and
<code>iparam$NUM_THREADS</code> specifications. Conflicts are resolved as stated in their documentation.
</p>
<p>The element <code>dparam$LOWER_OBJ_CUT</code> can be used to incorporate a best
bound found in an earlier successless optimization attempt; per default, it is set to 0.5, since
the target function can take on integer values only and cannot be negative.
</p>
<p>If a valid starting value is not accepted by Mosek, it may be worthwhile to increase <code>dparam$INTPNT_CO_TOL_PFEAS</code>.
</p>
<p>Users of Mosek versions 9 and higher may want to play with <code>iparam$MIO_SEED</code>, which was introduced as a new parameter with Mosek version 9 (default: 42);
different seeds modify the path taken through the search space. Varying the seed may be an alternative to searching over different level orderings with function <code><a href="#topic+mosek_MIPsearch">mosek_MIPsearch</a></code>.
</p>
<p>Note that a user specified <code>mosek.params</code> should always contain the specifications shown under Usage.

It can be worthwhile playing with this option for improving the run time for certain settings; for example, with <code>nruns=48</code> and <code>nlevels=c(2,2,3,4,4)</code>, <code>heurist=0.05</code> performs better than the default 0.5.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The functions initially solve a linear optimization problem for obtaining a design with the requested resolution;
if a start value is provided, this step is skipped; if <code>find.only=TRUE</code>, the functions stop after this step.
If <code>find.only=FALSE</code>, the number of shortest words is optimized, followed by the numbers of words of length up to <code>kmax</code>.
The argument <code>forced</code> allows to specify an existing array that is to be extended (e.g. to double or triple size;
extension by a small number of runs will usually not be possible) in an optimized way.
</p>
<p>For all but very small problems, it is likely advisable to choose <code>kmax</code> equal to the requested resolution (the default), and to proceed to longer words only after it has been made sure that the shortest word length has been optimized (as far as possible with reasonable effort). Further improvements of the same can be attempted by applying <code>gurobi_MIPcontinue</code> or <code>mosek_MIPcontinue</code> to the result object returned by the function. Note that it is possible to switch from using Mosek to using Gurobi or vice versa.
An example for an optimization sequence can be found in the package overview at <code><a href="#topic+DoE.MIParray">DoE.MIParray</a></code>.
</p>
<p>In case of long run times, escaping from the gurobi run will most likely be unsuccessful and might even leave R in an unstable state; thus, one should think carefully about the affordable run times. On the contrary, it should usually be doable to escape a Mosek run; the remaining code of the function will still be executed and will return the final state.
</p>
<p>Besides the run time, the number of threads is a very important resource control parameter. The default assumes that the user wants to use two of the computer's multiple cores. For using Gurobi's or Mosek's default (which is in most cases the use of all available cores), choose <code>nthread=0</code>.
</p>
<p>The default Gurobi parameters have been chosen after systematic experimentation with a limited set of scenarii und Gurobi version 7.5.1.  The choice of <code>MIQCPMethod=0</code> was instrumental in many cases; changing it to -1 may occasionally be tried. The MIPFocus parameter also appears beneficial in many cases; changing it to 0 (leave choice to Gurobi) can be an option; it was slightly better than choice 1 for mixed level designs with relatively small run sizes, while choice &ldquo;1&rdquo; was substantially better for the other cases. The heuristics proportion has been chosen as 0.5, because this choice seemed the best compromise for the situations considered. Note, however, that these parameters deteriorate performance for very simple cases, e.g. the test cases of Fontana (2017). For such cases, using <code>MIQCPMethod=-1</code>, <code>MIPFocus=0</code> and <code>heurist=0.05</code> will be preferrable; the defaults were chosen in this way, since doubling or even tripling very short run times was decided to be less detrimental than making more difficult problems completely intractable.
</p>
<p>For Gurobi, several optimization parameters are switched off for the initial linear optimization step:
the parameters <code>Heuristics</code> and <code>MIPFocus</code> are reset to their defaults (0.05 and 0).
</p>
<p>Gurobi always stores the file &quot;gurobi.log&quot; in the working directory; even if storage of the log is
suppressed with the default option <code>LogFile=""</code> or directed to another location by specifying a path, the default file &quot;gurobi.log&quot; is created and filled with a small amount of content. Thus, make sure to use a different file name when intentionally storing some log.
</p>
<p>For Mosek, storing log output can be accomplished by directing the printed output to a suitable storing location. Note that the setting <code>iparam$LOG_MIO_FREQ = 100</code> reduces the frequency of printing a log line for branch-and-cut optimization by the factor 10 versus the default. Parallelization in Mosek is not well-protected against interference from screen activity (for example). Thus, one should switch off logging to screen or otherwise, when working with many (all available) threads in parallel (<code>LOG=0</code> instead of <code>LOG_MIO_FREQ = 100</code> in the list <code>iparam</code>).
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>an array of class <code><a href="DoE.base.html#topic+oa">oa</a></code>, possibly with the following attributes:
<code>MIPinfo</code>, which is either an object of class <code>qco</code> or a simple list with information (which would be the <code>info</code> element of the object of class <code>qco</code> in case the last optimization was not successful), <code>history</code> as a list of problem and solution lists, and <code>matrices</code> as a list of matrix lists. Presence or absence of <code>history</code> and <code>matrices</code> is controlled by option <code>detailed</code>, while <code>MIPInfo</code> is present if the optimization can be potentially improved by improving the last step (stop because of time limit and not because of optimal value) or by improving the number of longer words.
</p>


<h3>Installation</h3>

<p>Gurobi and Mosek need to be separately installed; please follow vendors' instructions; see also <code><a href="#topic+mosek_MIPsearch">mosek_MIPsearch</a></code> for more comments.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>The functions are not meant for situations, for which a full factorial design would be huge; the mixed integer problem to be solved has at least <code>prod(nlevels)</code> binary or general integer variables and will likely be untractable, if this number is too large. (For extending an existing designs, since some variables are fixed, the limit moves out a bit.)
</p>
<p>Please be aware that escaping a Gurobi run will be not unlikely to leave the computer in an unstable situation.  If function <code>gurobi_MIParray</code> is successfully interrupted by the &lt;ESC&gt; key or &lt;Ctrl&gt;-&lt;C&gt;, it will usually be necessary to restart R in order to free all CPU usage.
</p>
<p>If a Mosek run is interrupted by the &lt;ESC&gt; key, it is advised to execute the command <code>Rmosek::mosek_clean()</code> afterwards; this may help prevent problems from unclean closes of mosek runs.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Note that it is possible to continue optimization with Gurobi, if it was started with Mosek, and vice versa. The tool will transform the problem into the respective other format.
</p>
<p>Usage of options is analogous to functions <code><a href="#topic+mosek_MIParray">mosek_MIParray</a></code> and <code><a href="#topic+gurobi_MIParray">gurobi_MIParray</a></code>, respectively, where these are described in more detail.
</p>
<p>For some applications, usability of <code>mosek_MIPcontinue</code> is hampered in Mosek versions up to 8 by the fact that Mosek's presolve routines identify additional integer variables and fail to recognise user-specified starting values for these that are not exactly integer-valued. According to Mosek ApS, this is scheduled to be remedied with Mosek Version 9 (version 9 is now available; I have not checked whether this was indeed fixed).
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>an array of class <code>link[DoE.base]{oa}</code>, if not optimized to GMA with info for further continuation (see documentation of <code><a href="#topic+mosek_MIParray">mosek_MIParray</a></code> or <code><a href="#topic+gurobi_MIParray">gurobi_MIParray</a></code>)

<code>iparam$NUM_THREADS</code> specifications. Conflicts are resolved as stated in their documentation.
</p>
<p>The element <code>dparam$LOWER_OBJ_CUT</code> can be used to incorporate a best
bound found in an earlier successless optimization attempt; per default, it is set to 0.5, since
the target function can take on integer values only and cannot be negative.

different seeds modify the path taken through the search space for a given level ordering; thus, varying seeds can also be the route to choose where searching over level 
orderings is not feasible. 
</p>
<p>Note that a user specified <code>mosek.params</code> should always contain the specifications shown under Usage.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The search functions have been implemented, because the algorithm's behavior may 
strongly depend on the order of factors in case of mixed level arrays. 
In many examples, Mosek quickly improved the objective function which 
then stayed constant for a long time; thus, it may be promising to run 
<code>mosek_MIPsearch</code> with <code>maxtime=60</code> (or even less). See also 
Groemping and Fontana (2019) for examples of successful applications of the search 
functionality.
</p>
<p>Even though Gurobi was less successful as a search tool in the examples that 
were examined so far, it may be helpful for other examples.
</p>
<p>The options suppress printed output from the optimizers themselves.
</p>
<p>Mosek Version 9 has gained a seed argument (<code>iparam$MIO_SEED</code>, 
which implements the Mosek parameter <code>MSK_IPAR_MIO_SEED</code>). 
Playing with seeds in <code>mosek_MIParray</code> may be an alternative to using the search approach, 
because it may lead to different paths through the search space for a fixed ordering of the <code>nlevels</code> vector. 
So far, I have only very little experience with using seeds; user reports are very welcome.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>an array of class <code><a href="DoE.base.html#topic+oa">oa</a></code> with the attributes added 
by <code>mosek_MIParray</code> or <code>gurobi_MIParray</code>, resp. <br />
In addition, the attribute <code>optorder</code> contains the vector of level orders that yielded the best design; 
if <code>listout=TRUE</code>, also the attributes <code>orders</code> and <code>allplans</code>.
</p>
<p>Objects with the attribute <code>allplans</code> are quite large. If the attribute is 
no longer needed, it can be removed from an object named <code>obj</code> 
(replace with the name of your object) by the command <br />
<code>attr(obj, "allplans") &lt;- NULL</code>

<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table role = "presentation">
<tr><td><code id="mosek2gurobi_+3A_qco">qco</code></td>
<td>

<p>a mixed integer optimization problem of class <code>qco</code>, as generated

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The functions treat the special <code>qco</code> objects created by package 
<span class="pkg">DoE.MIParray</span>: these are minimization problems with linear equality 
constraints and possibly conic quadratic constraints, as suitable for the 
problems treated in <span class="pkg">DoE.MIParray</span>.
</p>
<p>Class <code>qco</code> objects on their own only occur as interim results of the 
optimization functions <code>mosek_MIParray</code>, 
<code>mosek_MIPcontinue</code>, 
<code>gurobi_MIParray</code> or <code>gurobi_MIPcontinue</code>. Where it might be useful, 
the class <code>link[DoE.base]{oa}</code> output objects of the optimization functions 
contain an attribute <code>MIPinfo</code> of class <code>qco</code>. For reducing the size of 
an object that is not going to be used for further improvement, 
the following command can be run for extracting the 
the useful information content from the <code>qco</code> object and replacing the large
<code>MIPinfo</code> attribute with this much smaller object: <br />
<code>attr(obj, "MIPinfo") &lt;- attr(obj, "MIPinfo")$info</code><br />
Make sure to only run this command if <code>MIPinfo</code> attribute is indeed of class <code>qco</code> 
and further optimization is not intended.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>an object of S3 class <code>qco</code> (see Details section)

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The functions do <em>not</em> do any problem solving, they serve the sole purpose of exporting problems so that they can be addressed by solvers other than Mosek or Gurobi. The target solver must be able to process the MPS format.
</p>
<p><code>create_ILPlist</code> creates a list with one or more integer linear problems for creating designs of at least the specified resolution. The problems are in Mosek formatting.
</p>
<p><code>write_MPSILPlist</code> writes a list produced by <code>create_ILPlist</code> to one or several MPS files, one file per list element. If not suppressed, a toc file is also created (suffix <code>_toc.txt</code>), which contains the number of runs, the target resolution and the elements of <code>nlevels</code> for each MPS file.
</p>
<p><code>write_MPSMIQP</code> creates and writes a problem for improving the number of shortest words, in a form that corresponds to general MPS format, without extensions by Mosek or Gurobi. The problem has a quadratic objective like in Groemping and Fontana (2019) Eq.(2Q) (instead of Eq.(2L), which is solved by Gurobi and Mosek).
</p>
<p>The example section demonstrates on a small example how these functions can be used.
</p>
<p>For <code>write_MPSMIQP</code>, a start array can be provided from a previous linear optimization (this is not enforced).
If an admissible start array is provided, <code>write_MPSMIQP</code> initially prints the GWLP of that start array.
Otherwise, it warns of inadmissibility. The start value cannot be stored in the MPS file. Instead, for a non-NULL start array,
a separate file (suffix <code>.start</code>) is created, and users have to work out how they can make their solver use that start solution (which is stored in the form of a counting vector, see example section).
Note that the availability of a start array can improve the ability of a solver to find an optimum solution. However, this is not always the case,
there are also instances for which a better solution is found without providing a start solution.
</p>
<p>For <code>write_MPSMIQP</code>, a lower bound for the objective value
can substantially improve the run time, if the solution achieves that lower bound. The lower bound is not provided in the MPS file, and its detail depends on the optimizer's way to implement quadratic problems (see example section for how to obtain it). Users have to work out how to provide that bound to their optimizer.
</p>
<p>Note that it can take a long time to write the mps files, if the problem has many variables (the number of variables is <code>prod(nlevels)</code>).
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Function <code>create_ILPlist</code> creates a list of one or more optimization problems,
which can be used in a call to function <code>write_MPSILPlist</code>.
</p>
<p>Function <code>write_MPSILPlist</code> returns a table of contents matrix for the written files. If <code>toc=TRUE</code>, that value is also written to a separate file with suffix <code>toc</code>.
</p>
<p>Function <code>write_MPSMIQP</code> returns the start vector (in counting vector representation), if <code>start</code> is not NULL; that vector is also written to a separate file with suffix <code>start</code>.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>It can take an optimizer a long time to confirm optimality after finding an optimum. For the quadratic problem, it is therefore very beneficial to provide an optimal value to the algorithm, where possible (see example section).
</p>
<p>The functions are not meant for situations, for which a full factorial design would be huge. Even though the functions do not solve anything, MPS files will be very large and writing them will be quite slow for such cases.
