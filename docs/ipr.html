Iterative Proportional Repartition (IPR) algorithm
</h2><span id='topic+ipr'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Estimating the health cost repartition among diseases in the presence of multimorbidity, i.e. when some patients have multiple diseases. Using the Iterative Proportional Repartition algorithm (see reference below), the goal is to estimate the average cost for each disease, starting from the global health costs available for each patient.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>ipr(X, y, print.it=FALSE, start=rep(1,dim(X)[2]), cutup=Inf, cutlow=cutup,
epsrel=0.001, epsabs=0.1, maxiter=1000, det=FALSE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table role = "presentation">
<tr><td><code id="ipr_+3A_x">X</code></td>
<td>
<p>Matrix with <code class="reqn">x_{ij}=1</code> if patient <code class="reqn">i</code> suffers from disease <code class="reqn">j</code> and <code class="reqn">x_{ij}=0</code> otherwise. Each row thus refers to one patient and each column to one disease. The number of columns of <code>X</code> corresponds to the number of diseases considered.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="ipr_+3A_y">y</code></td>
<td>
<p>Vector where <code class="reqn">y_i</code> is the global health cost of patient <code class="reqn">i</code>. The length of <code>y</code> must be equal to the number of rows of <code>X</code>.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="ipr_+3A_print.it">print.it</code></td>
<td>
<p>Logical. If <code>TRUE</code>, the number of the current iteration and the current estimates are printed.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="ipr_+3A_start">start</code></td>
<td>
<p>Vector of initial estimates of the average cost for each disease to start IPR algorithm. Default is an initial average cost of 1 for all diseases. The length of <code>start</code> must be equal to the number of columns of <code>X</code>.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="ipr_+3A_cutup">cutup</code>, <code id="ipr_+3A_cutlow">cutlow</code></td>
<td>
<p>Options which can be used to get a robust version of IPR. If the current allocated cost of disease <code class="reqn">j</code> for patient <code class="reqn">i</code> is more than <code>cutup</code> times more expansive (or less then <code>cutlow</code> times less expansive) than the current average cost estimate of that disease <code class="reqn">j</code>, then this outlying allocated cost is not taken into account in the next iteration to compute the average cost of disease <code class="reqn">j</code>. By default, <code>cutup</code> and <code>cutlow</code> are set to <code>Inf</code>.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="ipr_+3A_epsrel">epsrel</code></td>
<td>
<p>Stopping criterion such that the IPR algorithm stops if for all diseases, the current estimated average cost differs by less than 100*<code>epsrel</code> percent from what it was at the previous iteration. The default value is 0.001. Should be set to 0 to ignore that criterion.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="ipr_+3A_epsabs">epsabs</code></td>
<td>
<p>Stopping criterion such that the IPR algorithm stops if for all diseases, the current estimated average cost differs (in absolute value) by less than <code>epsabs</code> percent from what it was at the previous iteration. The default value is 0.1. Should be set to 0 to ignore that criterion.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="ipr_+3A_maxiter">maxiter</code></td>
<td>
<p>Maximal number of iterations of IPR algorithm. The default value is 1000.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="ipr_+3A_det">det</code></td>
<td>
<p>Logical. If <code>TRUE</code>, the allocated costs of each disease for each patient are given, by returning a matrix <code class="reqn">Y</code> where <code class="reqn">y_{ij}</code> is the estimated cost of disease <code class="reqn">j</code> for patient <code class="reqn">i</code>.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Let us consider <code class="reqn">n</code> patients and <code class="reqn">p</code> diseases. We are given a matrix <code class="reqn">X</code> such that <code class="reqn">x_{ij}=1</code> if the patient <code class="reqn">i</code> suffers from disease <code class="reqn">j</code> and <code class="reqn">x_{ij}=0</code> otherwise. We are also given a vector <code class="reqn">y</code>, where <code class="reqn">y_i</code> is the global health cost of patient <code class="reqn">i</code>. In order to estimate the average cost of each disease, the IPR algorithm works as follows:
</p>
<p>1. Start with some initial estimates <code class="reqn">mu_j</code>, e.g. <code class="reqn">mu_j</code>=1 for all <code class="reqn">j=1,\dots,p</code>. Those initial estimates are stored in the vector <code>start</code>.
</p>
<p>2. Allocate the cost <code class="reqn">y_i</code> among the diseases diagnosed for patient <code class="reqn">i</code>, proportionally to the current estimates <code class="reqn">mu_j</code>.
</p>
<p>3. Update the current estimate of <code class="reqn">mu_j</code> by averaging the specific costs obtained in step 2 for the disease <code class="reqn">j</code> over the patients having that disease.
</p>
<p>4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until a stopping criterion, based on relative or absolute distance between two consecutive iterations. The stopping criterion can be defined with <code>epsabs</code> or <code>epsrel</code>.
</p>
<p>By construction, the IPR algorithm satisfies two properties. First, it allows to obtain positive estimates for each average disease cost. Secondly, it allows to retrieve the total health costs. In other words, the sum of the estimates <code class="reqn">mu_j</code> multiplied by the number of patients suffering from <code class="reqn">j</code> is equal to the sum of the costs <code class="reqn">y_i</code>.
</p>
<p>The estimate of total cost <code class="reqn">tau_j</code> spent for disease <code class="reqn">j</code> as well as the estimated proportion <code class="reqn">pi_j</code> of the total costs which is allocated to disease <code class="reqn">j</code> are also returned by our function.
</p>
<p>Mathematically, <code class="reqn">tau_j</code> is the sum over <code class="reqn">i=1</code> to <code class="reqn">i=n</code> of <code class="reqn">X_{ij}*mu_j</code>, while <code class="reqn">pi_j</code> is defined by <code class="reqn">tau_j</code> divided by the sum of all <code class="reqn">tau_k</code>.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'># Here is a first example with 10 patients and 4 diseases:
X &lt;- matrix(c(1,0,0,0,
0,1,1,0,
0,1,0,1,
1,0,0,1,
1,1,1,0,
0,0,1,1,
0,1,0,0,
1,1,0,0,
0,1,1,1,
0,0,0,1),ncol=4,byrow=TRUE)

y &lt;- c(500,200,100,400,1000,500,100,300,800,2000)

# If we would use a linear model without intercept to estimate the average
# disease costs, we would obtain a negative value for disease 2.
lm(y~X-1)

# The IPR algorithm provides only positive estimates
ipr(X,y)


# Here is a second example:
X &lt;- matrix(c(1,0,0,1,1,1),nrow=3,byrow=TRUE)
y &lt;- c(5000,500,6600)

# We have three patients. The first one has only disease 1 with a cost of 5000.
# The second one has only disease 2 with a cost of 500 (i.e. ten times less
# expansive than disease 1). The third patient has both diseases with
# a cost of 6600 (i.e. 5000 + 500 + an extra cost of 1100).

# Using a linear model, one would allocate the extra cost equally between
# the three patients. The estimated average cost would thus be 5000+(1100/3)
# for disease 1 and 500+(1100/3) for disease 2.
lm(y~X-1)

# Using IPR algorithm, one allocates the extra cost taking into account that
# disease 1 is ten times more expansive than disease 2 when occuring alone.
# One thus gets an estimated average cost of 5500 for disease 1 and
# of 550 for disease 2.
ipr(X,y)
