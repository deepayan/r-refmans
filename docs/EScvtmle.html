<td>Description:</td>
<td>The experiment selector cross-validated targeted maximum likelihood estimator (ES-CVTMLE) aims to select the experiment that optimizes the bias-variance tradeoff for estimating a causal average treatment effect (ATE) where different experiments may include a randomized controlled trial (RCT) alone or an RCT combined with real-world data. Using cross-validation, the ES-CVTMLE separates the selection of the optimal experiment from the estimation of the ATE for the chosen experiment. The estimated bias term in the selector is a function of the difference in conditional mean outcome under control for the RCT compared to the combined experiment. In order to help include truly unbiased external data in the analysis, the estimated average treatment effect on a negative control outcome may be added to the bias term in the selector.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The experiment selector cross-validated targeted maximum likelihood estimator (ES-CVTMLE) aims to select the experiment that optimizes the bias-variance tradeoff for estimating a causal average treatment effect where different experiments may include a randomized controlled trial (RCT) alone or an RCT combined with real-world data.
Using cross-validation, the ES-CVTMLE separates the selection of the optimal experiment from the estimation of the ATE for the chosen experiment.
In order to avoid positivity violations, the package internally trims RWD so that no baseline covariate values are not represented in the RCT if active treatment is not available in the RWD.
The estimated bias term in the selector is a function of the difference in conditional mean outcome under control for the RCT compared to the combined experiment.
In order to help include truly unbiased external data in the analysis, the estimated average treatment effect on a negative control outcome may be added to the bias term in the selector by setting the parameter NCO to the character name of a negative control variable in the dataset.
For more details about this method, please see Dang et al. (2022).

<h2 id='wash'>WASH Benefits Bangladesh Dataset</h2><span id='topic+wash'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This dataset was constructed from the publicly-available WASH Benefits Bangladesh cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) dataset.
The results of this trial were originally reported by Luby et al. (2018), and the original dataset may be downloaded from https:://osf.io.wvyn4/.
The trial found no evidence of an effect of an intervention to improve sanitation, including construction of improved latrines, on child length-for-age Z-scores (laz).
A subsequent re-analysis by Arnold et al. (2018) of the control arm of this dataset as an observational cohort did find an effect of having an improved latrine at baseline on child laz.
The authors concluded that observational analyses of water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) interventions may suffer from unmeasured confounding.
To demonstrate how conducting a small RCT combined with unbiased or biased observational data could prevent unmeasured confounding from influencing results, we construct the dataset for this software package, as follows.
Study 1: A random sample of 150 &quot;Sanitation&quot; arm observations and 150 &quot;Control&quot; arm observations with complete information was taken from the overall RCT, with &quot;study&quot; variable set to 1.
Study 2: A second random sample of 150 &quot;Sanitation&quot; arm observations and 150 &quot;Control&quot; arm observations with complete information was taken from the remaining RCT observations, with &quot;study&quot; variable set to 2 to mimic an unbiased external dataset.
Study 3: From the &quot;Control&quot; arm observations not included in the study=1 sample, 150 observations who had improved latrines at baseline and 150 observations who did not have improved latrines at baseline were sampled, with &quot;study&quot; variable set to 3 to mimic a biased external dataset.
The data contained in this file consist of all three &quot;studies&quot;.
Because this study was not set up to have a negative control outcome for length-for-age Z-score, the options were limited.
We would like a variable that is associated with socioeconomic status (SES) because that is a likely cause of the unmeasured confounding highlighted by Arnold et al. (2018).
We chose number of household members &lt;=18 years old as an NCO, because prior studies have shown this variable to be associated with SES in Bangladesh (The World Bank, 2013),
but it is unlikely to be affected by having an improved latrine.
We scaled this variable to match the scale of the true outcome (length-for-age Z-score).
