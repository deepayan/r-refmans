<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The <code>agriTutorial</code> package provides R software for the analysis of
five agricultural example data sets as discussed in the paper:
'A tutorial on the statistical analysis of factorial experiments with qualitative
and quantitative treatment factor levels' by Piepho and Edmondson (2018). See:
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jac.12267">View</a>
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Code<br />
</p>
<p>The example code produces statistical analysis for the five agricultural data sets
in Piepho &amp; Edmondson (2018) and also produces additional graphical analysis.
The data for each example is provided as a data frame which loads
automatically whenever the package is loaded and the code for each analysis is provided
as a set of examples.
</p>
<p>Printed output defaults to the device terminal window but can be diverted to a suitable
text file by using a sink file command: see <code>help(sink)</code>, if required. Similarly, graphical output defaults
to the device graphics window but can be diverted to a suitable graphics device if required:
see <code>vignette('agriTutorial')</code> for further details,
</p>
<p>The example code demonstrates some basic methodology for the analysis of data from designed
experiments but there are other methods available in R and it is straightforward to
extend the example code by adding functionality from other packages. One source of package information
is the set of 'task views' available at: <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/">Task Views</a>.
</p>
<p>Polynomials<br />
</p>
<p>The polynomials used in this tutorial are either raw polynomials or orthogonal polynomials.
</p>
<p>A raw polynomial is a weighted sum of the powers and cross-products
of a set of treatment or nuisance effect vectors.
</p>
<p>An orthogonal polynomial is a weighted sum of orthogonal combinations of the powers and cross-products
of a set of treatment or nuisance effect vectors.
</p>
<p>Raw polynomials have a direct interpretation as a fitted polynomial model
but can be numerically unstable whereas orthogonal polynomials are
numerically stable but give coefficients which are linear combinations of the
required polynomial model coefficients and are difficult to interpret.
</p>
<p>Raw polynomials are the polynomials of choice
for most analyses but sometimes orthogonal polynomials can be useful when, for example, fitting
higher-degree polynomials in a long series of repeated measures (see example 4).
</p>
<p>Functional marginality<br />
</p>
<p>Polynomial expansions are based on a Taylor series expansion and normally
must include all polynomial terms up to and including the maximum degree of the expansion.
This is the property of functional marginality and applies to any polynomial or response surface
model including models with polynomial interaction effects (Nelder, 2000). In this tutorial,
all polynomial and response surface models will be assumed to conform with the requirements of
functional marginality.
</p>
<p>Packages<br />
</p>
<p>The example code depends on a number of R packages each of which must be installed on the user machine before
the example code can be properly executed. The required packages are lmerTest, emmeans, pbkrtest, lattice, nlme and
ggplot2, all of which should install automatically. If, for any reason, packages need to be installed by hand,
this can be done by using <code>install.packages("package name")</code>.
</p>
<p>NB. It is important to keep packages updated using the update.packages() command.
</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Gomez &amp; Gomez (1984, p. 143) report a rice experiment with three management practices
(minimum, optimum, intensive), five different amounts of nitrogen (N) fertilizer
(0, 50, 80, 110, 140 kg/ha), and three varieties (V1, V2, V3). The experiment
involved variety and management as qualitative treatment factors and nitrogen
fertilizer as a quantitative treatment factor. Overall, there were 45 treatments with
three replicates in complete replicate blocks. The fertilizer treatments were applied
to main plots, the management practices to split-plots and the varieties to split-split-plots.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Section 1
</p>
<p>Section 1 examines treatment effects by fitting qualitative factorial models and the first analysis
calculates a full analysis of variance (Table 1) for main plots (nitrogen),
split-plots (management) and split-split-plots (variety). Each type of experimental unit (or &quot;stratum&quot;)
requires a separate error term in the fitted analysis.
</p>
<p>The second analysis (Table 2) uses a REML mixed model analysis to find treatment means and SE's for each marginal
treatment classification averaged over all the other treatment factors, together with estimates of
pairwise contrasts of treatment means and the SE's of the pairwise treatment comparisons. This analysis fits
the full set of nitrogen-by-variety interaction effects assuming additive management effects and the fit of the model
is tested by a graphical plot of the model residuals.
Residual plots provide an important check on model assumptions but many more options for model testing are
available and further methods for diagnostic testing are examined in the subsequent examples.
</p>
<p>The third analysis (Table 3) shows a mixed model analysis of the full factorial model fitted by REML using the
lmer function of the lme4 package. Generally with mixed models, determination of the denominator degrees of
freedom for Wald-type F- and t-statistics becomes an issue, and here we use the method proposed by
Kenward &amp; Roger (1997).
</p>
<p>Section 2
</p>
<p>Section 2 examines treatment effects by fitting polynomial models and the first step calculates
a full set of four raw polynomials for the 5-levels of N using the poly() function.
The N rates are re-scaled by division by 100 to improve numerical stability.
</p>
<p>The second step fits a mixed model polynomial analysis of nitrogen effects assuming additive management effects (Table 7).
In this analysis, most of the nitrogen treatment effect can be explained by linear and quadratic trend effects.
but it is important to note that there is a non-negligible Variety x Cubic N interaction effect. This suggests
that not all the varieties responded in a similar way to the N treatments and that some further analysis of the
data may be required (see also the N plots of individual varieties and replicates in Fig 1).
</p>
<p>The third step fits the required model for the actual fitted model coefficients (Table 8).
When estimating model effects, only effects that are significant for the fitted model or that are marginal to
those effects (functional marginality) should be included in the model therefore only linear and quadratic nitrogen effects
are included in this model. The fitted model for the nitrogen effects fits the actual actual nitrogen levels used
in the experiment therefore this model provides the required coefficients for the actual applied nitrogen levels.
</p>
<p>Section 3
</p>
<p>Section 3 provides checks on some of the assumptions underlying the blocks-by-treatments model.
</p>
<p>The first analysis in this section shows a
complete partition of the blocks-by-treatments interaction effects into factorial mean square terms where
all the terms that contain a replicate:variety interaction effect are estimates of the split-split-plot error variance.
If the blocks-by-treatments assumptions are valid, all the estimates of the split-split-plot error variance
are expected to have
the same error mean square. However, the Replicate:variety effect has a mean square of 1.54 on 4 degrees
of freedom whereas the Replicate:management:variety:nitrogen effect has a mean square of 0.26 on 32 degrees of freedom.
The ratio of these mean squares is 5.92 with an F-probability of 0.00110 on 4 and 32 degrees of freedom, which
means that the Replicate:variety interaction effect is significantly inflated relative to the
Replicate:management:variety:nitrogen effect. This shows that the assumptions underlying the blocks-by-treatments
analysis of the model are invalid with a high level of probability.
</p>
<p>The 4 degrees of freedom in the Replicate:variety interaction effect are the differences between the three varieties
differenced between the three replicate blocks. Fig S1 shows graphical plots of
variety effects in each replicate block averaged over management effects, and there is clear evidence that the effects of
Variety 1 in blocks 1 and 2 were different from the effects of Variety 1 in block 3.
</p>
<p>The second analysis in Section 3 shows a complete partition of the blocks-by-treatments
interaction effects into factorial mean square terms ignoring Variety 1. This
analysis shows a reasonably good fit to the assumed additive block which
supports the hypothesis that the non-additivity of the block-and-treatment effects in the
full unrestricted analysis is mainly due to Variety 1.
</p>
<p>The final analysis in Section 3 shows an analysis of variance of the treatment effects ignoring Variety 1.
In this analysis, the management:variety interaction effect becomes significant at the 0.00992 probability level
compared with a non-significant management:variety interaction effect in the analysis of the full data set.
</p>
<p>Such anomalies are not uncommon in the analysis of real data sets and it is the task of
the statistician to identify anomalies as and when they occur. Factorial designs can be very powerful for practical
research but, as demonstrated with this data set, the analysis of such designs is complex and anomalies
can be easily missed.
Unless an anomaly is due to an easily identified cause such as an incorrectly recorded data point, it is likely
that the anomaly will need to be investigated by further discussion with the research workers.
It is a mistake to suppose that data from a designed experiment can be analysed statistically in isolation from
the research workers who conducted the experiment.

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Petersen (1994, p. 125) describes an experiment conducted to assess the effects
of five different quantities of N-fertiliser (0, 35, 70, 105 and 140 kg N/ha) on root dry

<p>The first stage of the analysis is the calculation of raw polynomial powers of N using the poly() function.
The N rates are re-scaled by division by 100 to improve numerical stability.
</p>
<p>The second stage fits a full polynomial analysis of variance based on polynomial contrasts which are
fitted in sequence from the lowest to the highest. This is equivalent to the analysis shown in Tables 4 and 5
of Piepho and Edmondson (2018) except that a complete partition into single degree of freedom polynomial contrasts is
shown here compared with the pooled 'lack of fit' term shown in Tables 4 and 5.
</p>
<p>The third stage fits a quadratic regression model with linear and quadratic terms only.
This model provides the model coefficients, standard errors and the confidence intervals
shown in Table 6 of Piepho and Edmondson (2018). A set of diagnostic plots are fitted for
the fitted quadratic regression model to check the validity of the model assumptions.
</p>
<p>Finally, a smoothed quadratic graph of the yield versus the N rate is plotted to show the
goodness of fit of the quadratic regression model. This plot corresponds to plot Fig 3 in
Piepho and Edmondson (2018).

<h2 id='example3'>Example 3: Polynomial regression model with two quantitative level treatment factors</h2><span id='topic+example3'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>(Gomez &amp; Gomez, 1984, p. 401) report a two-factor nitrogen uptake greenhouse experiment on rice
involving duration of water stress (W) and level of nitrogen application (N) with four complete replicates of each treatment.
The experiment had four water-stress levels (0, 10, 20 and 40 days) applied as main-plot treatments and
four nitrogen rates (0, 90, 180 and 270 kg/ha) applied as sub-plot treatments. The four sub-plot treatments were randomized
within main plots and the four main plot treatments were randomized within complete replicate blocks.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The first stage of the analysis is the calculation of polynomial powers of N and W using the poly() function.
The N rates are re-scaled by division by 100 while the W rates are re-scaled by division by 10.
</p>
<p>The second stage shows a Pearson residual plot of the untransformed N uptake data versus a Pearson residual plot of
the log transformed N uptake data. Comparison of the two plots shows that the untransformed residuals
increase as the fitted values increase whereas the log transformed N uptake residuals are approximately constant
over the full range of the fitted values. This shows that a log transformation of the N uptake data gives a
dependent variate with constant variance over the full range of fitted values which shows that a simple
unweighted analysis of variance is valid for the effects of the treatment factors.
</p>
<p>Sometimes the original scale of measurement is the proper scale of measurement for an analysis,
e.g. an analysis of actual measured crop yields, and then it might be appropriate to fit a weighted
analysis of variance in the original scale of measurement of the dependent variable (see Faraway 2002 Chapter 5).
However, the log transformation model assumes a proportional rather than an additive model
for treatment effects and, in this example, a proportional model for nitrogen uptake may well be a more natural
physiological model than a simple additive model.
</p>
<p>The next stage compares the fit of a first-order linear model (Table 9) versus a second-order quadratic
model (Table 10). The first-order model shows significant lack-of-fit and is not adequate for the
data. The second-order model is also not fully adequate for the data as there is a significant N lack of
fit term indicating a significant cubic effect. However, the magnitude of the cubic effect is
relatively small and it will be assumed here that a quadratic model is adequate for the data.
</p>
<p>The final stage fits regression coefficients for the quadratic response surface model on the
re-scaled water stress and re-scaled nitrogen rate treatments. The fitted coefficients are then used to
plot the fitted quadratic log uptake curves versus the nitrogen rate treatments and the
water stress treatments, as shown in Fig 4.
</p>
<p>Note that in this analysis all the polynomial models are built by adding individual polynomial effects in accordance with the requirements of
functional marginality.

<h2 id='example4'>Example 4: One qualitative treatment factor with repeated measurements over time.</h2><span id='topic+example4'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Milliken &amp; Johnson (1992, p. 429) discuss data which they describe as repeated leaf index measurements
on sorghum. Their data set comprises five replicate blocks of four sorghum varieties and they assume equally spaced
repeated measurements on each plot in each block on five consecutive occasions starting two weeks after emergence.
No further information is given but it appears that the data is simulated or made-up rather than real.
Although real data is more authentic, it can sometimes be useful to discuss the analysis of an example data set
from the literature, even when the data is simulated. Milliken &amp; Johnson discuss multivariate analysis
of variance of the data but this method take no account of the ordered relationship between repeated
observations or the likely correlation structure of the data and we will discuss alternative correlation models
that are specifically intended to account for the underlying structure of repeated measures data. The interested
reader can, if desired, refer to Milliken &amp; Johnson (1992) Chapter 31 for comparison of the
different approaches.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p><strong>Section 1</strong> calculates polynomials for weeks and blocks using the <code>poly()</code> function.
Two sets of polynomials for weeks, raw and orthogonal, are calculated and saved as <code>sorghum$rawWeeks</code>
and <code>sorghum$polWeeks</code> respectively. Orthogonal polynomials for blocks are calculated and saved as
<code>sorghum$polBlocks</code>. It is important to note that the <code>poly()</code> function calculates all polynomial
contrasts up to the required degree but does NOT include the zero-degree polynomial.
Additionally, the block variable <code>varblock</code> is saved as a factor <code>factblock</code>.
</p>
<p><strong>Section 2</strong> compares five different correlation structures for the repeated measures analysis
using the gls() function of the nlme package. Each analysis fits a full factorial model for the variety-by-weeks and
blocks-by-weeks effects assuming block and treatment additivity. The goodness of fit of the five models is
compared by AIC statistics where the smaller the AIC the better the fit. Here, the AR(1)+nugget model fitted
by the <code>corExp()</code> function gave the best fitting model. See <code>help(corExp)</code>for further information about
the corExp() function. Note that <code>corSymm</code> represents a general correlation structure and will, presumably, give
an analysis similar to a multivariate analysis of variance. Although this structure appears to give the best fit according to the
negative log likelihood statistic, this
criterion takes no account of the number of estimated variance parameters p in the variance model which, in the case of the
<code>corSymm</code> model, is p = 15, compared to only p = 2 for the AR(1) model. When assessed by the AIC statistic, the
<code>corSymm</code> model gave the least good fit of any of the non-null correlation structures which is strong evidence that the
multivariate analysis of variance method discussed by Milliken &amp; Johnson (1992) will lack power.
</p>
<p><strong>Section 3</strong> fits a full regression model over the five weeks of repeated measures and tests for possible
variety and variety-by-weeks interactions effects. The weeks factor is decomposed into individual
polynomial contrasts (see Table A2 and Table 14) to test the significance of each individual variety-by-weeks polynomial
effect.
The analysis of polynomial contrasts shows that the variety-by-weeks interaction is due mainly to the
degree-1 = <code>variety:rawWeeks[,1]</code> and the
degree-2 = <code>variety:rawWeeks[,2]</code> effects, although there is also some evidence
of higher-degree variety-by-weeks interaction effects. The analysis also shows the <code>corExp()</code> range and
nugget statistics for the full fitted model and these are used to calculate the correlation coefficient
usingthe formula <code>rho=(1-nugget)*exp(-1/range)</code>. Note that this formula is different from the the formula used in
Tables A1 and A2 and will give a different value of <code>rho</code>: see <code>help(corExp)</code>.
</p>
<p><strong>Section 4</strong> fits a quadratic regression model for weeks assuming the degree-3 and degree-4 polynomial week effects are zero.
The average effects of blocks are fitted by <code>polBlocks</code> and the interactions between the blocks and the weeks are fitted
by <code>polBlocks:(rawWeeks[,1] + rawWeeks[,2] + polWeeks[,3]+ polWeeks[,4])</code>. The <code>gls()</code> algorithm requires the same
polynomial weeks contrasts in both the blocks and the varieties models which is why raw degree-1 and degree-2 weeks contrasts have been
used for the blocks-by-weeks interaction model. However, orthogonal polynomials have better numerical stability than raw polynomials so
orthogonal polynomial contrasts have been used for the degree-3 and degree-4 weeks contrasts.
The summary analysis shows all variety effects as differences from
the intercept which, in this analysis, is variety 1 therefore all model effects in Table 15 can be derived by
adding appropriate effects to the intercept. If SED's are required, these must be calculated from the
variance/covariance matrix which can be extracted by the code <code>vcov()</code>. Using this matrix, the SED for variety differences was
calculated to be 0.172, the SED for the variety-by-linear weeks slope parameters was calculated to be 0.117 and the SED
for the variety-by-quadratic weeks slope parameters was calculated to be 0.0192. These estimates are approximately 2-3 percent
larger than those shown in Table 15 but it is not clear if the discrepancies are due to the model specification or to a
difference between the R and the SAS software. Possibly the implementation of the Kenward-Roger method of adjusting
the denominator d.f. and the estimated variance-covariance matrix of the estimated fixed effects might be different for the two
algorithms. The range, nugget and correlation coefficient are extracted and displayed and a
graphical plot of the studentized residuals from the quadratic regression model is also shown.
</p>
<p><strong>Section 5</strong> fits a quadratic regression model for variety-by-week interaction effects assuming
a full degree-4 polynomial model for weeks and blocks-by-weeks effects.
The quadratic regression model in Section 4 corresponds to the regression model used for Tables 14 and 15 of Piepho and Edmondson (2018)
but the range = 3397131013 and nugget = 0.4605535 of this model are very different from the range = 10.35774 and nugget = 0.1720444 of the
full factorial model. As there is  evidence from Table A2 that the degree-3 and degree-4 polynomial
weeks effects are non-negligible, the quadratic model for weeks effects in Section 4 may be inadequate for the data and the model
may be underfitted. In this section, the assumption that the degree-3 and degree-4 polynomial weeks effects are zero is relaxed and
a full degree-4 model for weeks and block-by-weeks interaction effects is fitted. The fitted model for treatment effects needs to be
as parsimonious as possible to ensure that estimates
of treatment effects are robust against model assumptions and a degree-2 regression model for variety-by-weeks effects
appears to be the most appropriate treatment model for this data. With this model, the values of the auto-correlation parameters
are: range = 42.75763, nugget = 0.3586337 and
correlation = 0.6265403 which are much closer to the autocorrelation parameters from the full factorial model than are those from
Section 4. As the model fits the full polynomial weeks model, it is not necessary to use polynomial blocks contrasts which gives a substantial
simplification in coding.
</p>
<p><strong>Comment</strong> The model fitted in Section 5 appears to be the best model available based on the generalized least squares method but
it is clear from the graphical plots of studentized residuals that the fitted data contains outliers that are not
well accommodated by the fitted model. If the data was from a real experiment, further information about the data might be available but as the data
seems to be artificial this option is not available. In this situation, various robust methods of model fitting or regression analysis
that can accommodate non-standard distributions or model outliers are available. However, these methods are beyond the scope of
this tutorial and will not be discussed further here.

<h2 id='example5'>Example 5: Transformation of treatment levels to improve model fit</h2><span id='topic+example5'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Mead (1988, p. 323) describes an experiment on spacing effects with turnips,
which was laid out in three complete blocks. Five different seed rates
(0.5, 2, 8, 20, 32 lb/acre) were tested in combination with four different row widths
(4, 8, 16, 32 inches), giving rise to a total of 20 treatments.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Transformation of the dependent variable will often stabilize the variance of the observations
whereas transformation of the regressor variables will often simplify the fitted model. In this
example, the fit of a regression model based on the original seed rate and row width variables is compared
with the fit of a regression model based on the log transformed seed rates and log transformed row widths.
In each case, the model lack-of-fit is examined by assessing the extra variability explained when the
Density and Spacing treatment factors and their interactions are added to the quadratic regression models.
All yields are logarithmically transformed to stabilize the variance.
</p>
<p>The first analysis fits a quadratic regression model of log yields on the untransformed seed rates and row
widths (Table 16) while the second analysis fits a quadratic regression model of log yields on the log
transformed seed rates and log transformed row widths (Table 17). The analysis of variance of the first model
shows that significant extra variability is explained by the Density and
Spacing factors and this shows that a quadratic regression model is inadequate for the untransformed regressor
variables. The analysis of variance of the second model, however, shows no significant extra variability
explained by the Density and Spacing factors and this shows that the quadratic regression model with the log
transformed regressor variables gives a good fit to the data and therefore is the preferred model for the
observed data.
</p>
<p>The superiority of the model with the log transformed regressor variables is confirmed by comparing the fit of the
quadratic regression model for the untransformed regressor variables (Figs 8 and 9) versus the fit of the
quadratic regression model for the log transformed regressor variables (Figs 10 and 11).
</p>
<p>Fig 12a shows diagnostic plots for the fit of a quadratic model with untransformed regressor variables
while Fig 12b shows corresponding diagnostic plots for the fit of a quadratic model with
loge transformed regressor variables. Each of the four types of diagnostic plots in the two figures
shows an improvement in fit for the transformed versus the untransformed regressor variables.

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>(Gomez &amp; Gomez, 1984, p. 401): Nitrogen uptake (g/pot) of rice was studied in a two-factor
greenhouse experiment involving duration of water stress (W) and level of nitrogen application (N).
The experiment had four water-stress levels (0, 10, 20 and 40 days) as main-plot treatments and
four nitrogen rates (0, 90, 180 and 270 kg/ha) as sub-plot treatments. The main plots were
randomized in four complete blocks.

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Gomez &amp; Gomez (1984, p. 143) report a rice experiment with three management practices
(minimum, optimum, intensive), five different amounts of nitrogen (N) fertilizer
(0, 50, 80, 110, 140 kg/ha), and three varieties (V1, V2, V3). The experiment
involved variety and management as qualitative treatment factors and nitrogen
fertilizer as a quantitative treatment factor. Overall, there were 45 treatment

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Mead (1988, p. 323) describes an experiment on spacing effects with turnips,
which was laid out in three complete blocks. Five different seed rates
(0.5, 2, 8, 20, 32 lb/acre) were tested in combination with four row widths
(4, 8, 16, 32 inches), giving rise to a total of 20 treatments.
Turnip yields (in lb per plot) were logarithmically transformed for
analysis because this stabilized the variance (Mead, 1988; also see Figure 12).
