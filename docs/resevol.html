<td>Description:</td>
<td>Simulates individual-based models of agricultural pest management
    and the evolution of pesticide resistance. Management occurs on a spatially
    explicit landscape that is divided into an arbitrary number of farms that
    can grow one of up to 10 crops and apply one of up to 10 pesticides. Pest
    genomes are modelled in a way that allows for any number of pest traits with
    an arbitrary covariance structure that is constructed using an evolutionary
    algorithm in the mine_gmatrix() function. Simulations are then run using the
    run_farm_sim() function. This package thereby allows for highly mechanistic
    social-ecological models of the evolution of pesticide resistance under
    different types of crop rotation and pesticide application regimes.</td>

<h2 id='initialise_inds'>Initialise individuals</h2><span id='topic+initialise_inds'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Initialise new individuals into the IBM. This function is generally not needed
because it is run inside the run_farm_sim function to generate new individuals
for simulations. To initialise individuals with this function, it is necessary
to set the mine_output argument to output from the mine_gmatrix function. This
output includes all of the information necessary to build individuals with
genomes that produce traits that covary in a pre-specified way. The arguments
of this function include addition information for building the individual
array, which is a two-dimensional array in which each individual occupies a 
row, and each column specifies a character of the individual (including all
genome loci). See vignettes for a more detailed explanation.

<hr>
<h2 id='make_landscape'>Landscape initialisation</h2><span id='topic+make_landscape'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Initialise the landscape for a simulation. This should not normally need to 
be done explicitly with this function because it is run inside of the 
run_farm_sim function, but this gives the option to generate a landscape 
without actually running a simulation. All landscapes are produced as three
dimensional arrays with varying numbers of rows and columns that determine
landscape size, and a depth of 21 layers. The top layer defines which cells
belong to which farm, while the remaining layers define how much of a given
crop is on the landscape cell (2-11) or how much pesticide has been applied
to it (12-21). An arbitrary number of farms are placed in a blocked design 
on the landscape using a shortest split-line algorithm, which attempts to 
make farm size as even as possible. Specifying public land is possible, and
adds sections of land that are not farms, but this is not recommended.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>make_landscape(
  terrain = NA,
  rows = NA,
  cols = NA,
  depth = 21,

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Mine networks for establishing the link between genome and g-matrix. The 
output from this function is required to run individual-based simulations
in the rest of the package. The key input to this function, 'gmatrix', is a
(square) covariance matrix, with each row and column representing a trait for
the individual-based model. This function will run an evolutionary algorithm
to try to find a network that produces traits with the covariance structure
of gmatrix from a set of random standard normal values. The network from loci
values to trait values goes through a number of linked nodes to achieve this, 
and each generation tests the stress of the resulting network in terms of 
expected squared deviation of trait covariances from the input gmatrix. 
Simulations can take minutes to hours or longer, depending on parameters 
chosen and the number of traits. See vignettes for a more comprehensive
explanation for what this function is doing.

<h2 id='run_farm_sim'>Initialise individuals and simulate farming</h2><span id='topic+run_farm_sim'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Initialises a new set of individuals and then simulates farming over time.
This is the main function that runs individual-based simulations of crop and
pesticide use and the evolution of pesticide resistance over time. To run 
this function, output from the mine_gmatrix function is required to specify
the covariance structure of individual traits and individual genomes. The
arguments to this function are used to initialise a landscape with the 
make_landscape function and initialise individuals with the initialise_inds
function. After initialisation, the simulation continues for up to a set 
number of time steps (unless extinction occurs), and individuals on the
landscape feed, encounter pesticide, move, reproduce, and die depending upon
the arguments specified in this function. After a specified number of time
steps, the crop or pesticide applied to a landscape cell can also change. The
end result is an evolving population of individuals that express traits 
that can potentially affect fitness (e.g., food consumption, pesticide
consumption, movement). Population level statistics are calculated by 
default and printed to a CSV, but individual level data (which includes all 
individual characteristics in a large table) need to be turned on because 
files can become extremely large (use print_inds with extreme caution and
print_last with care).

</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="run_farm_sim_+3A_terrain">terrain</code></td>
<td>
<p>Insert a custom terrain of different farms, which takes the
form of a matrix that includes a sequence of natural numbers in all matrix
elements. For example, if there are 4 farms, then all matrix elements must
be 1, 2, 3, or 4. Beyond this requirement, there is no restriction on where 
different farms are placed; the do not even need to be contiguous on the 
landscape. Note that a custom terrain will override the arguments farms, 
xdim, and ydim. For example, if the matrix given to the terrain argument has
10 rows and 10 columns, then the simulation will automatically set xdim and
ydim equal to 10 without any warnings. Also note that these terrain values do
not necessarily need to be farms. Through the use of a custom landscape and 
pesticide rotation option, these cells could represent something like 
diversionary feeding sites or even buildings or rivers. See vignettes and 
other documentation for details.</p>

<tr><td><code id="run_farm_sim_+3A_trait_means">trait_means</code></td>
<td>
<p>This provides the mean values of the evolving pest traits
in the initialised pest population, which by default are zero. To change 
mean trait values in the initialised population, the trait_means argument
requires a vector of the same length as the number of evolving pest traits
defined within the function (i.e., if there are two evolving traits in the
simulation, &quot;T1&quot; and &quot;T2&quot;, then trait_means should be a vector of length 2).
Note that mean trait values may change as the population evolves, so the
values in this vector define only the means of the initial population.</p>

<tr><td><code id="run_farm_sim_+3A_land_edge">land_edge</code></td>
<td>
<p>This sets what happens at the edge of the landscape. Three 
options are possible, including &quot;torus&quot;, &quot;leaky&quot;, and &quot;reflect&quot;. A torus
results in no edge, such that pests that leave one side of the landscape
end up on the other side. A leaky edge causes pests to leave the landscape
and the simulation entirely, so they are effectively no longer recorded. A 
reflective edge causes pests to bounce at the edge back in the direction from
which they came. The default and recommended edge is a torus.</p>

<tr><td><code id="run_farm_sim_+3A_crop_growth">crop_growth</code></td>
<td>
<p>This sets the amount by which landscape cell values
increase for each crop from one time step to the next. This might be used to
model the increase in biomass caused by plant growth on the landscape cell.
The way in which growth is enacted is set by crop_growth_type. Values for
crop_growth can either be a single number (in which case, the growth amount
applies to all crop types) or a vector of the same length as crop_types (in
which case, vector indices give the amount of growth for each crop number).</p>

<p>This clarifies whether crop growth should be 
&quot;none&quot; (default), &quot;geometric&quot;, or &quot;linear&quot;. If geometric, then the value of a
landscape cell increases to cell_value * (1 + crop_growth). If linear, then
a fixed value crop_growth is added to the existing cell value. Note that for
linear growth, this fixed value is only added if the existing cell value is
greater than zero (else it is assumed that there is no crop to grow).</p>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The output in the R console is a list with two elements; the first 
element is a vector of parameter values used by the model, and the second 
element is the landscape in the simulation. The most relevant output will be
produced as CSV files within the working directory. When get_stats = TRUE, 
a file named 'population_data.csv' is produced in the working directory. When
print_last = TRUE, a complete array of all individuals and their 
characteristics is printed for the last time step in the working directory in
a file named 'last_time_step.csv' (for large simulations, this file can be 
&gt; 1GB in size). When print_inds = TRUE, a complete array of all individuals 
in all time steps is produced in the working directory in a file named
'individuals.csv' (use this option with extreme caution for all but the
smallest simulations).

<h2 id='stress_test'>Mine_gmatrix output stress</h2><span id='topic+stress_test'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Run a diagnoistic test on the stress output of mine_gmatrix. The mine_gmatrix
function produces a network from loci to traits for a pre-specified trait
covariance structure. This covariance structure is estimated from network
values, but can vary due to error in the loci values (standard random normal
numbers). This function will test the stress of a network (mean deviation 
between the estimated covariance matrix and the pre-specified one) a given
number of times to produce a distribution of stress estimates.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>stress_test(mine_output, indivs = 1000, reps = 10)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table role = "presentation">
<tr><td><code id="stress_test_+3A_mine_output">mine_output</code></td>
<td>
<p>The output from mine_gmatrix, which will be used to
initialise the genomes and traits of pests.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="stress_test_+3A_indivs">indivs</code></td>
<td>
<p>The number of individuals to use in the stress test. Higher
values produce a larger sample size for more accurate estimates of the true
covariance structure produced by the network, and therefore the actual stress
expected from it.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="stress_test_+3A_reps">reps</code></td>
<td>
<p>The number of times a new set of individuals will be initialised
for estimating the covariance between traits and calculating its stress.</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A vector of stress values the same length as 'reps'.
</p>
