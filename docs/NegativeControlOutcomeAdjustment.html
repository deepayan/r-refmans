Estimation of Vaccine Efficacy using Negative Control Outcomes
</h2><span id='topic+NegativeControlOutcomeAdjustment'></span><span id='topic+NegativeControlOutcomeAdjustment-package'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This package uses observational cohort data from a secondary outcome Y2, 
and from measured strata indicator confounders W, 
to adjust estimates of the log-relative risk of a binary outcome Y1 with a binary exposure T.  
Adjustment for Y2 reduces bias by unmeasured confounders.  
A key assumption is that Y2 is not affected by T (&quot;negative control outcome&quot;).  
Another key assumption is that effects of unmeasured confounders on Y1 are proportional 
to their effects on Y2.
This work was motivated by studies of vaccine efficacy against vaccine-targeted strains 
in which measurements of infection against several non-vaccine-targeted strains are also available. 
In such study, Y1 would typically be the indicator of infection with a given vaccine-targeted strain, 
or the indicator of infection with at least one of several vaccine-targeted strains, 
and Y2 would be the total number of infections with the non-vaccine-targeted strains.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Y1 is coded 0 or 1 for absence or presence of the event (e.g. infection with one
given vaccine-targeted strain, or infection with at least one vaccine-targeted strain).
Y2 is coded with non-negative integers for the total number of events. 
T is coded 0 for unexposed (e.g. received placebo) and 1 for exposed (e.g. received vaccine). 
W is a stratification indicator covering K possible strata. 
It can be entered as a factor, vector, matrix, or data frame. 
</p>
<p>The package includes three methods: Joint-NC, Joint-MH, and SS-Joint. 
If there are many strata, the program recommends using the Joint-MH method, 
which works with many, possibly sparse, strata. 
If there are only a few large strata, the SS-Joint method can be used,
which makes fewer assumptions. 
If W is null (i.e. there are no data on measured strata), the Joint-NC method can be used.

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A simulated toy data set mimicking data from a vaccine trial.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

 
<p>A data frame consisting of 1000 subjects with primary outcome of interest (<code>Y1</code>) 
as infected with HPV type 16, secondary outcome (<code>Y2</code>) as  
the total number of infections with 20 non-targeted HPV types, 
vaccine assignment (<code>T</code>), and two categorical covariates <code>Age</code>
and <code>Region</code> with 13 and 3 levels respectively.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Observations with missing or non-finite values will be removed from the data. <br />
For the <code>SS-Joint</code> method, strata that yield non-finite estimates
are removed from the calculations, and strata that contain 
too few observations as defined by <code>minObsPerStrata</code> above are removed. <br />
</p>
<p><b>Joint-MH</b> 
</p>
<p><code>Joint-MH</code> reduces bias due to unmeasured confounders in the estimate of the primary
outcome relative risk, by using the treatment effect on the secondary outcome. 
<code> Joint-MH</code> first estimates jointly the effects of the treatment on the primary and 
secondary outcomes from stratification (with Mantel-Haenszel-type weights) on the measured confounders, 
and then uses the non-zero estimated effect on the secondary outcome to &quot;subtract off&quot; bias due to 
unmeasured confounders. If the observed confounder used to stratify only has a few large strata, 
method <code>SS-Joint</code> could be used instead. 
If information on observed confounders is not provided, method <code>Joint-NC</code> is used instead.
</p>
<p><b>Joint-NC</b>
</p>
<p><code>Joint-NC</code> reduces bias due to unmeasured confounders in the estimate of the primary outcome
log-relative risk, by using the treatment effect on the secondary outcome. <code>Joint-NC</code> first estimates
jointly the effects of the treatment on the primary and secondary outcomes, by using log-links, 
and then uses the non-zero estimated effect on the secondary outcome to &quot;subtract off&quot; bias due
to unmeasured confounders. Information on potential observed confounders is not used with this method.
</p>
<p><b>SS-Joint</b>
</p>
<p><code>SS-Joint</code> applies method <code>Joint-NC</code> within each stratum of the observed confounders, 
in order to reduce bias due to unmeasured confounders in the primary outcome log-relative risk estimate. 
More precisely, it estimates jointly the effects of the treatment on the primary and secondary outcomes, 
by using log-links, within each stratum. 
It then &quot;subtracts off&quot; the non-zero estimated effects on the secondary outcome from the estimated effects 
on the primary outcome, respectively in each stratum. 
<code>SS-Joint</code> finally combines efficiently these stratum-specific estimates by taking a weighted combination, 
with weights inversely proportional to their respective variances. 
If no information on observed confounders is provided, method <code>Joint-NC</code> is used instead. 
If data is available on a categorical confounder, but with many possibly sparse strata, 
we recommend using method <code>Joint-MH</code> instead. 
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A data frame with columns <code>method</code>, <code>beta_1.hat</code>, <code>sd.beta_1.hat</code>, <code>n.strata</code> and
<code>error.message</code>, where <code>beta_1.hat</code> is the &quot;de-biased&quot; estimate of the 
treatment effect on <code>Y1</code>, 
<code>sd.beta_1.hat</code> is the sandwich estimate for the standard deviation of <code>beta_1.hat</code>,
and <code>n.strata</code> is the number of strata used in the calculation.
