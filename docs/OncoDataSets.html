<h2 id='VALungCancer_list'>VA Lung Cancer Data Set</h2><span id='topic+VALungCancer_list'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This dataset, VALungCancer_list, is a list containing two components: 'X' and 'y'. The data comes from a randomized trial of two treatment regimens for lung cancer. The 'X' component contains the covariates, and the 'y' component contains the survival time data. This dataset is typically used in survival analysis.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>data(VALungCancer_list)

<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A list with 2 components:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>X</dt><dd><p>A numeric matrix with 1137 rows and 19 columns, representing the covariates.</p>
</dd>
<dt>y</dt><dd><p>A numeric matrix with 1137 rows and 12 columns, representing the survival time data. The columns include 'time' for the survival time and other variables related to survival analysis.</p>

<h2 id='VinylideneLiverCancer_df'>Effect of Vinylidene Fluoride on Liver Cancer</h2><span id='topic+VinylideneLiverCancer_df'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This dataset, VinylideneLiverCancer_df, is a data frame containing data from an experiment to investigate whether vinylidene fluoride induces liver damage. The dataset records the levels of three serum enzymes (SDH, SGOT, SGPT) under four different dosages of vinylidene fluoride. Increased serum enzyme levels are indicative of liver damage.
Real data which are available on page 10 of Silvapulle and Sen (2005) and in a report prepared by Litton Bionetics Inc in 1984. These data were used in an experiment to find out whether vinylidene fluoride gives rise to liver damage.

<h3>Usage</h3>
