<td>Description:</td>
<td>Offers a general framework of multivariate mixed-effects
        models for the joint analysis of multiple correlated outcomes with clustered 
        data structures and potential missingness proposed by Wang et al. (2018) &lt;<a href="https://doi.org/10.1093%2Fbiostatistics%2Fkxy022">doi:10.1093/biostatistics/kxy022</a>&gt;. The missingness of outcome values may 
        depend on the values themselves (missing not at random and non-ignorable), 
        or may depend on only the covariates (missing at random and ignorable), or both.
        This package provides functions for two models: 1) mvMISE_b() 
        allows correlated outcome-specific random intercepts with a factor-analytic 
        structure, and 2) mvMISE_e() allows the correlated outcome-specific 
        error terms with a graphical lasso penalty on the error precision matrix. Both functions 
        are motivated by the multivariate data analysis on data with clustered structures 
        from labelling-based quantitative proteomic studies. These models and functions 
        can also be applied to univariate and multivariate analyses of clustered data 
        with balanced or unbalanced design and no missingness.</td>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The multivariate mixed-effects selection model consists of two components, the outcome model and the missing-data model. Here the outcome model 
is a multivariate mixed-effects model, with correlations among multivariate outcomes modeled via correlated outcome-specific random intercepts with 
a factor-analytic structure
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">\mathbf{y}_{i} =  \mathbf{X}_{i}\boldsymbol{\beta} + \left(\mathbf{I}_{K}\otimes\mathbf{1}_{n_{i}}\right) \boldsymbol{\tau}b_{i}+\mathbf{e}_{i},</code>
</p>

<p>where <code class="reqn">i</code> denotes a cluster/batch, <code class="reqn">n_{i}</code> is the number of samples/observations within each cluster,
<code class="reqn">\boldsymbol{\tau}</code> is a <code class="reqn">K\times 1</code> vector for the outcome-specific variance components corresponding to 
the random effect <code class="reqn">b_i</code> (a standard normal random variable), and <code class="reqn">K</code> is the number of outcomes. 
By default, a matrix with each column as an indicator for each outcome is generated and is used as the random-effect design matrix (<code class="reqn">\mathbf{I}_{K}\otimes\mathbf{1}_{n_{i}}</code>), 
and the model will estimate the outcome-specific random intercepts.
The factor-analytic structure assumes the outcome-specific random intercepts are identically correlated and this model 
is often used to capture the highly structured experimental or biological correlations among naturally related outcomes.
For example, the correlation among multiple phosphopeptides (i.e. phosphorylated segments) of a same protein.
The model assumes that the random effects are derived from a latent variable <code class="reqn">b_i</code> with a loading vector <code class="reqn">\boldsymbol{\tau}</code>.
With this model specification, only <code class="reqn">K</code> parameters instead of <code class="reqn">K(K+1)/2</code> are needed 
in the estimation for the covariance matrix of random-effects, and as such that greatly facilitates the computation.
</p>
<p>The missing-data model can be written as
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">\textrm{Pr}\left(r_{ik}=1|\mathbf{y}_{ik}\right)= \mathrm{exp}\left(\phi_{0} + \phi_{1}/n_{i}\cdot \mathbf{1}^{'}\mathbf{y}_{ik}  + 
\phi_{2}/n_{i}\cdot \mathbf{1}^{'}\mathbf{c}_{i} \right),</code>
</p>

<p>where <code class="reqn">r_{ik}</code> is the missing indicator for the k-th outcome in the i-th cluster. If <code class="reqn">r_{ik}=1</code>, the values of the k-th outcome in the i-th cluster  
<code class="reqn">\mathbf{y}_{ik}</code> are missing altogether.
The estimation is implemented via an EM algorithm. Parameters in the missing-data models can be specified via the arguments miss_y and cov_miss. If miss_y 
= TURE, the missingness depends on the outcome values. 
If cov_miss is specified, the missingness can (additionally) depend on the specified covariate (cov_miss).
</p>
<p>The model also works for fully observed data if miss_y = FALSE and cov_miss = NULL. It would also work for a univariate outcome with potential missing values, if the outcome Y is a matrix
with one column.

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function fits a multivariate mixed-effects selection model with correlated outcome-specific error terms and potential missing values in the outcome.
Here an outcome refers to a response variable, for example, a genomic feature. The proposed model and function jointly analyze multiple outcomes/features.
For high-dimensional outcomes, the model can regularize the estimation by shrinking the error precision matrix with a graphical lasso penalty.
Given the introduction of the penalty and the choice of tuning parameter often being data-dependant, we recommend using permutation to calculate
p-values for testing with the mvMISE_e model. Please see mvMISE_e_perm for calculating the permutation-based p-values.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The multivariate mixed-effects selection model consists of two components, the outcome model and the missing-data model. Here the outcome model 
is a multivariate mixed-effects model. The correlations among multivariate outcomes are modeled via outcome-specific error terms with an unstructured covariance matrix. 
For the i-th cluster, the outcome matrix <code class="reqn">\mathbf{Y}_{i}</code> is a matrix of <code class="reqn">n_i</code> samples (rows) and <code class="reqn">K</code> outcomes (columns). 
Let <code class="reqn">\mathbf{y}_{i} = \mathrm{vec}\left( \mathbf{Y}_{i} \right)</code>. 
The outcome vector <code class="reqn">\mathbf{y}_{i}</code> can be modelled as
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">\mathbf{y}_{i}  = \mathbf{X}_{i}\boldsymbol{\beta}+\mathbf{Z}_{i}\mathbf{b}_{i}+\mathbf{e}_{i},</code>
</p>

<p>where the random effects (<code class="reqn">\mathbf{b}_{i}</code>) follow a normal distribution <code class="reqn">\mathbf{b}_{i}\sim N(\mathbf{0},\mathbf{D})</code>; 
and the error term <code class="reqn">\mathbf{e}_{i}=\mathrm{vec}\left(\mathbf{E}_{i}\right) \sim N(\mathbf{0},\boldsymbol{\Sigma}\otimes\mathbf{S}_{i})</code>.  
The matrix <code class="reqn">\mathbf{S}_{i}</code> is an <code class="reqn">n_i\times n_i</code> diagonal matrix with diagonal elements corresponding to the error variances of the <code class="reqn">n_i</code> samples 
within the i-th cluster. 
The variances for the first and other samples can be different if sigma_diff = TRUE. 
The matrix <code class="reqn">\boldsymbol{\Sigma}</code> captures the error (or unexplained) covariances among the <code class="reqn">K</code> outcomes. 
For high-dimensional outcomes, if ADMM = TRUE (the default), the off-diagonal elements of the inverse of <code class="reqn">\boldsymbol{\Sigma}</code> will be shrinked
by a graphical lasso penalty and the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is used to estimate <code class="reqn">\boldsymbol{\Sigma}</code>. 
If ADMM = FALSE, no penalty is used to estimate the unstructured error covariance matrix, and that is 
only applicable to low-dimensional multivariate outcomes.
</p>
<p>The missing-data model can be written as
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">\textrm{Pr}\left(r_{ik}=1|\mathbf{y}_{ik}\right)= \mathrm{exp}\left(\phi_{0} + \phi_{1}/n_{i}\cdot \mathbf{1}^{'}\mathbf{y}_{ik}  + 
\phi_{2}/n_{i}\cdot \mathbf{1}^{'}\mathbf{c}_{i} \right),</code>
</p>

<p>where <code class="reqn">r_{ik}</code> is the missing indicator for the k-th outcome in the i-th cluster. If missing <code class="reqn">r_{ik}=1</code>, the k-th outcome in the i-th cluster <code class="reqn">\mathbf{y}_{ik}</code> 
is missing altogether.
The estimation is implemented within an EM algorithm framework. Parameters in the missing-data models can be specified via the arguments miss_y and cov_miss. If miss_y 
= TURE, the missingness depends on the outcome values. 
If cov_miss is specified, the missingness can (additionally) depend on the specified covariates (cov_miss).
</p>
<p>The model also works for fully observed data if miss_y = FALSE and cov_miss = NULL. It would also work for an univariate outcome with potential missing values, if the outcome Y is a matrix
with one column.

If a covariate is specific for the k-th outcome, one may set all the values corresponding to the other outcomes to be zero. If X is common across outcomes, the row number of X equals 
the row number of Y. Otherwise if X is outcome-specific, the row number of X equals the number of elements in Y, i.e., outcome-specific X is stacked across outcomes within
each cluster. See the Examples for demonstration.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="mvMISE_e_perm_+3A_id">id</code></td>
<td>
<p>a vector for cluster/batch index, matching with the rows of Y, and X if it is not outcome specific.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="mvMISE_e_perm_+3A_zidx">Zidx</code></td>
<td>
<p>the column indices of matrix X used as the design matrix of random effects. The default is 1, i.e., a random intercept is included 
if the first column of X is a vector of 1s. If Zidx=c(1,2), then the model would estimate the random intercept and the random effects of the 2nd column in the covariate matrix X.
The random-effects in this model are assumed to be independent.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="mvMISE_e_perm_+3A_maxiter">maxIter</code></td>
<td>
<p>the maximum number of iterations for the EM algorithm.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="mvMISE_e_perm_+3A_tol">tol</code></td>
<td>
<p>the tolerance level for the relative change in the observed-data log-likelihood function.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="mvMISE_e_perm_+3A_lambda">lambda</code></td>
<td>
<p>the tuning parameter for the graphical lasso penalty of the error precision matrix. It can be selected by AIC (an output).</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="mvMISE_e_perm_+3A_cov_miss">cov_miss</code></td>
<td>
<p>the covariate that can be used in the missing-data model. If it is NULL, 
the missingness is assumed to be independent of the covariates.
Check the Details for the missing-data model.
If it is specified and the covariate is not outcome specific, its length equals the length of id. If it is outcome specific, the outcome-specific covariate is stacked across outcomes within
each cluster.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="mvMISE_e_perm_+3A_miss_y">miss_y</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical. If TRUE, the missingness depends on the outcome Y (see the Details). The default is TRUE.
This outcome-dependent missing data pattern was motivated by and was observed in the mass-spectrometry-based quantitative proteomics data.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="mvMISE_e_perm_+3A_sigma_diff">sigma_diff</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical. If TRUE, the sample error variance of the first sample is different from that for the rest of samples within each cluster.
This option is designed and used when analyzing batch-processed proteomics data with the first sample in each cluster/batch being the common reference sample. The default is FALSE.</p>

<table>
<tr><td><code>Y</code></td>
<td>
<p>a 92 by 5 outcome/feature matrix, each row is a sample, and each 
column is an outcome/feature variable, with potential missing values (NAs).</p>

<tr><td><code>X</code></td>
<td>
<p>a 92 by 2 covariate matrix, each row is a sample, and each column 
is a covariate with the first column being 1s for the intercept. In this example, we simulated the 
covariates to be common for all the outcomes and would estimate the common/averaged effects for all outcomes. 
If a covariate is specific for the k-th outcome, one may set all the values corresponding to the other outcomes to be zero. </p>
