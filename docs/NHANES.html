<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This is survey data collected by the US National Center for Health Statistics
(NCHS) which has conducted a series of health and nutrition surveys since the
early 1960's. Since 1999 approximately 5,000 individuals of all ages are
interviewed in their homes every year and complete the health examination
component of the survey. The health examination is conducted in a mobile
examination centre (MEC).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>data(NHANES)
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>data frames with raw and resampled versions of the NHANES data.  See below for details
and descriptions of the varaibles.</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The NHANES target population is &quot;the non-institutionalized civilian resident
population of the United States&quot;.
NHANES, (American National Health
and Nutrition Examination surveys), use complex survey designs (see
http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/series/sr_02/sr02_162.pdf) that oversample certain
subpopulations like racial minorities. Naive analysis of the original NHANES
data can lead to mistaken conclusions. The percentages of people from each
racial group in the data, for example, are quite different from the way they
are in the population.
</p>
<p><code>NHANES</code> and <code>NHANESraw</code>
each include 75 variables available for the 2009-2010 and 2011-2012 sample years.
<code>NHANESraw</code> has 20,293 observations of these variables plus four additional
variables that describe that sample weighting scheme employed.
<code>NHANES</code> contains 10,000 rows of data resampled from
<code>NHANESraw</code> to undo these oversampling effects.
<code>NHANES</code> can be treated, for educational purposes,
as if it were a simple random sample from the American population.
</p>
<p>A list of the variables in
the data set follows appears below along with variable descriptions and links to the original
NHANES documentation.
</p>


<h3>NHANES warning</h3>

<p>The following warning comes directly from the NHANES web site:
</p>
<p>For NHANES datasets, the use of sampling weights and sample design variables
is recommended for all analyses because the sample design is a clustered design
and incorporates differential probabilities of selection.
If you fail to account for the sampling parameters, you may obtain biased estimates
and overstate significance levels.
</p>


<h3>Disclamer</h3>

<p>Please note that the data sets provided in this package are derived from the
NHANES database and have been adapted for educational purposes.
As such, they are NOT
suitable for use as a research database.  For research purposes you should
download original data files from the NHANES website and follow the analysis
instructions given there. Further details and relevant documentation can be
found on the following NHANES websites

and self-reported pregnancy status. Urine pregnancy tests were performed prior
to the dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) exam.
Persons who reported they were pregnant at the time of exam were assumed to
be pregnant. As a result, if the urine test was negative, but the subject
reported they were pregnant, the status was coded as <code>"Yes"</code>.
If the urine pregnancy results were negative and the respondent stated that they
were not pregnant, the respondent was coded as <code>"No"</code> If the urine pregnancy
results were negative and the respondent did not know her pregnancy status,
the respondent was coded <code>"unknown"</code>  Persons who were interviewed,
but not examined also have a value of <code>"unknown"</code>. In addition
there are missing values.
