<td>Description:</td>
<td>Biologically relevant, yet mathematically sound constraints are used
    to compute the propensity and thence infer the dominant direction of reactions
    of a generic biochemical network. The reactions must be unique and their 
    number must exceed that of the reactants,i.e., reactions &gt;= reactants + 2.  
            'ReDirection', computes the null space of a user-defined stoichiometry
    matrix. The spanning non-zero and unique reaction vectors (RVs) are 
    combinatorially summed to generate one or more subspaces recursively.  
            Every reaction is represented as a sequence of identical components 
    across all RVs of a particular subspace. The terms are evaluated with 
    (biologically relevant bounds, linear maps, tests of convergence, descriptive
    statistics, vector norms) and the terms are classified into forward-, reverse- 
    and equivalent-subsets. Since, these are mutually exclusive the probability 
    of occurrence is binary (all, 1; none, 0).
            The combined propensity of a reaction is the p1-norm of the 
    sub-propensities, i.e., sum of the products of the probability and maximum
    numeric value of a subset (least upper bound, greatest lower bound). This, 
    if strictly positive is the probable rate constant, is used to infer dominant
    direction and annotate a reaction as "Forward (f)", "Reverse (b)" or 
    "Equivalent (e)".
            The inherent computational complexity (NP-hard) per iteration suggests
    that a suitable value for the number of reactions is around 20.
            Three functions comprise ReDirection. These are check_matrix() and 
    reaction_vector() which are internal, and calculate_reaction_vector()
            which is external.</td>

<h2 id='calculate_reaction_vector'>calculate_reaction_vector()
This is the main function of the package 'ReDirection'.</h2><span id='topic+calculate_reaction_vector'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The input stoichiometry matrix of a generic biochemical network is checked
and modified after which the null space is computed.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>calculate_reaction_vector(smat, rar)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr><td><code id="calculate_reaction_vector_+3A_smat">smat</code></td>
<td>
<p>An input stoichiometry matrix of a generic biochemical network.
This is a mandatory argument.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="calculate_reaction_vector_+3A_rar">rar</code></td>
<td>
<p>A mandatory logical argument that indicates the orientation of the
reactions as rows (TRUE) or columns (FALSE) in the stoichiometry matrix.</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The non-zero null space spanning and the subspace-generated unique reaction
vectors (RVs) are recursively summed combinatorially and evaluated for
redundancy.
</p>
<p>The function compares the generated subspace vectors reaction-wise, i.e., as
sequences of identical terms across all RVs. These are then evaluated on the
basis of pre-defined criteria (descriptive statistics, linear maps, tests of
convergence, probability of occurrence, vector norms).
</p>
<p>The output for each reaction is the combined propensity (p1-norm) of the sub-
propensities and is strictly positive. This is the probable rate constant, is
used to infer the dominant direction of each reaction and annotate a reaction
as &quot;Forward (f)&quot; or &quot;Reverse (b)&quot; or &quot;Equivalent (e)&quot;.
Although, there is no restriction on the number of reactions, the inherent
computational complexity (NP-hard) involved per iteration suggests that an
suitable value for the number of reactions is around 20.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>code A numerically encoded ('0', no success; '1', success) text
message to the user and indicates the outcome of utilizing &quot;ReDirection&quot;.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>mx &lt;- matrix(c(1,0,0,0,0,1,0,-1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,-1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,-2,0,-1,
-1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,-1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1,0,1,0,-1,0,0,0,0,0,-1,0,1,0,0,-1,0,-1,0)
,byrow=TRUE,nrow=9,ncol=7)
calculate_reaction_vector(mx,TRUE)

</code></pre>

<hr>
<h2 id='check_matrix'>check_matrix()</h2><span id='topic+check_matrix'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function of the package 'ReDirection' checks whether the user-defined
stoichiometry matrix is suitable for further processing.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>check_matrix(input_mat, rxy)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr><td><code id="check_matrix_+3A_input_mat">input_mat</code></td>
<td>
<p>This is the user-defined stoichiometry matrix of a generic
metabolic network and is a mandatory argument.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="check_matrix_+3A_rxy">rxy</code></td>
<td>
<p>A mandatory logical argument that indicates the orientation of
reactions as rows (TRUE) or columns (FALSE) of the user-defined stoichiometry
matrix.</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>'ReDirection', is reaction-centric. This means that the computations and results
are solely based on the reactions. The number of unique reactions must exceed
the number of reactants (reactions &gt;= reactants + 2).
</p>
<p>Additionally, 'ReDirection' must know if the reactions are represented as
rows (TRUE) or columns (FALSE).
</p>
<p>'ReDirection', also checks for linear dependence (rows, columns) and removes
the same. This can perturb the indices of the matrix and users are advised to
check the input stoichiometry matrix a priori.
</p>
<p>The checked and modified matrix is returned and processed further.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>output_mat A checked and modified version of the stoichiometry matrix
which is returned for further computations.
</p>
<p>flag An indicator of the suitability of the user-defined input
stoichiometry matrix for further computations.
</p>

<hr>
<h2 id='reaction_vector'>reaction_vector()</h2><span id='topic+reaction_vector'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function of the package 'ReDirection', combinatorially sums non-zero
and unique reaction vectors of the null space and the generated subspace(s).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>reaction_vector(xsol)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr><td><code id="reaction_vector_+3A_xsol">xsol</code></td>
<td>
<p>The null space spanning vectors of the checked and modified user-
defined stoichiometry matrix.</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The resultant reaction vectors (RVs) comprise every unique reaction as a
sequence of identical components across  all RVs and are processed further.
</p>
<p>The RVs are evaluated for the presence of duplicated vectors and the same are
removed.
</p>
<p>If and only if the combined propensity of every reaction fulfills the output
criteria (non-zero, greater than unity) are the iterations stopped, otherwise
another commences.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>mtdf Vectors are the resultant reaction vectors which are computed by
by combinatorially summing the non-zero and null space spanning vectors and
the subspace(s) generated.
