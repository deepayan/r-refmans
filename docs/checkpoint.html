<tr>
<td>Description:</td>
<td>The goal of checkpoint is to solve the problem of package
    reproducibility in R. Specifically, checkpoint allows you to install packages
    as they existed on CRAN on a specific snapshot date as if you had a CRAN time
    machine. To achieve reproducibility, the checkpoint() function installs the
    packages required or called by your project and scripts to a local library
    exactly as they existed at the specified point in time. Only those packages
    are available to your project, thereby avoiding any package updates that came
    later and may have altered your results. In this way, anyone using checkpoint's
    checkpoint() can ensure the reproducibility of your scripts or projects at any
    time. To create the snapshot archives, once a day (at midnight UTC) Microsoft
    refreshes the Austria CRAN mirror on the "Microsoft R Archived Network"
    server (<a href="https://mran.microsoft.com/">https://mran.microsoft.com/</a>). Immediately after completion
    of the rsync mirror process, the process takes a snapshot, thus creating the
    archive. Snapshot archives exist starting from 2014-09-17.</td>

<h2 id='checkpoint'>Configures R session to use packages as they existed on CRAN at time of snapshot.</h2><span id='topic+checkpoint'></span><span id='topic+create_checkpoint'></span><span id='topic+use_checkpoint'></span><span id='topic+delete_checkpoint'></span><span id='topic+delete_all_checkpoints'></span><span id='topic+uncheckpoint'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Together, the checkpoint package and the checkpoint server act as a CRAN time machine.
</p>
<p>The <code>create_checkpoint</code> function installs the packages referenced in the specified project to a local library exactly as they existed at the specified point in time.  Only those packages are available to your session, thereby avoiding any package updates that came later and may have altered your results. In this way, anyone using the <code>use_checkpoint</code> function can ensure the reproducibility of your scripts or projects at any time. The <code>checkpoint</code> function serves as a simple umbrella interface to these functions. It first tests if the checkpoint exists, creates it if necessary with <code>create_checkpoint</code>, and then calls <code>use_checkpoint</code>.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>checkpoint(
  snapshot_date,
  r_version = getRversion(),
  checkpoint_location = "~",
  ...
)

create_checkpoint(
  snapshot_date,
  r_version = getRversion(),
  checkpoint_location = "~",
  project_dir = ".",
  mran_url = getOption("checkpoint.mranUrl", "https://mran.microsoft.com"),
  scan_now = TRUE,
  scan_r_only = FALSE,
  scan_rnw_with_knitr = TRUE,
  scan_rprofile = TRUE,
  force = FALSE,
  log = TRUE,
  num_workers = getOption("Ncpus", 1),
  config = list(),
  ...
)

use_checkpoint(
  snapshot_date,
  r_version = getRversion(),
  checkpoint_location = "~",
  mran_url = getOption("checkpoint.mranUrl", "https://mran.microsoft.com"),

  confirm = TRUE
)

delete_all_checkpoints(checkpoint_location = "~", confirm = TRUE)

<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>create_checkpoint</code> creates a local library (by default, located under your home directory) into which it installs copies of the packages required by your project as they existed on CRAN on the specified snapshot date. To determine the packages used in your project, the function scans all R code (<code>.R</code>, <code>.Rmd</code>, <code>.Rnw</code>, <code>.Rhtml</code> and <code>.Rpres</code> files) for <code><a href="base.html#topic+library">library</a></code> and <code><a href="base.html#topic+require">require</a></code> statements, as well as the namespacing operators <code>::</code> and <code>:::</code>.
</p>
<p><code>create_checkpoint</code> will automatically add the <code>rmarkdown</code> package as a dependency if it finds any Rmarkdown-based files (those with extension <code>.Rmd</code>, <code>.Rpres</code> or <code>.Rhtml</code>) in your project. This allows you to continue working with such documents after checkpointing.
</p>
<p>Checkpoint only installs packages that can be found on CRAN. This includes third-party packages, as well as those distributed as part of R that have the &quot;Recommends&quot; priority. Base-priority packages (the workhorse engine of R, including utils, graphics, methods and so forth) are not checkpointed (but see the <code>r_version</code> argument above).
</p>
<p>The package installation is carried out via the <a href="pkgdepends.html#topic+pkgdepends">pkgdepends</a> package, which has many features including cached downloads, parallel installs, and comprehensive reporting of outcomes. It also solves many problems that previous versions of checkpoint struggled with, such as being able to install packages that are in use, and reliably detecting the outcome of the installation process.
</p>
<p><code>use_checkpoint</code> modifies your R session to use only the packages installed by <code>create_checkpoint</code>. Specifically, it changes your library search path via <code>.libPaths()</code> to point to the checkpointed library, and then calls <code><a href="#topic+use_mran_snapshot">use_mran_snapshot</a></code> to set the CRAN mirror for the session.
</p>
<p><code>checkpoint</code> is a convenience function that calls <code>create_checkpoint</code> if the checkpoint directory does not exist, and then <code>use_checkpoint</code>.
</p>
<p><code>delete_checkpoint</code> deletes a checkpoint, after ensuring that it is no longer in use. <code>delete_all_checkpoints</code> deletes <em>all</em> checkpoints under the given checkpoint location.
</p>
<p><code>uncheckpoint</code> is the reverse of <code>use_checkpoint</code>. It restores your library search path and CRAN mirror option to their original values, as they were before checkpoint was loaded. Call this before calling <code>delete_checkpoint</code> and <code>delete_all_checkpoints</code>.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>These functions are run mostly for their side-effects; however <code>create_checkpoint</code> invisibly returns an object of class <code>pkgdepends::pkg_installation_proposal</code> if <code>scan_now=TRUE</code>, and <code>NULL</code> otherwise. <code>checkpoint</code> returns the result of <code>create_checkpoint</code> if the checkpoint had to be created, otherwise <code>NULL</code>.
</p>


<h3>Configuration</h3>

<p>The pkgdepends package which powers checkpoint allows you to customise the installation process via a list of configuration options. When creating a checkpoint, you can pass these options to pkgdepends via the <code>config</code> argument. A full list of options can be found at <code><a href="pkgdepends.html#topic+pkg_config">pkgdepends::pkg_config</a></code>; note that <code>create_checkpoint</code> automatically sets the values of <code>cran-mirror</code>, <code>library</code> and <code>r-version</code>.
</p>
<p>One important use case for the <code>config</code> argument is when you are using Windows or MacOS, and the snapshot date does not include binary packages for your version of R. This can occur if either your version of R is too old, or the snapshot date is too far in the past. In this case, you should specify <code>config=list(platforms="source")</code> to get checkpoint to download the <em>source</em> packages instead (and then compile them locally). Note that if your packages include C, C++ or Fortran code, you will need to have the requisite compilers installed on your machine.
</p>


<h3>Last accessed date</h3>

<p>The <code>create_checkpoint</code> and <code>use_checkpoint</code> functions store a marker in the snapshot folder every time the function gets called. This marker contains the system date, thus indicating the the last time the snapshot was accessed.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>## Not run: 

# Create temporary project and set working directory

example_project &lt;- paste0("~/checkpoint_example_project_", Sys.Date())

dir.create(example_project, recursive = TRUE)


# Write dummy code file to project

cat("
library(MASS)
library(foreach)
", file="checkpoint_example_code.R")


# Create a checkpoint by specifying a snapshot date
# recommended practice is to specify the R version explicitly
rver &lt;- getRversion()
create_checkpoint("2014-09-17", r_version=rver, project_dir=example_project)
use_checkpoint("2014-09-17", r_version=rver)

# more terse alternative is checkpoint(), which is equivalent to
# calling create_checkpoint() and then use_checkpoint() in sequence
checkpoint("2014-09-17", r_version=rver, project_dir=example_project)


# Check that CRAN mirror is set to MRAN snapshot
getOption("repos")


# Check that (1st) library path is set to ~/.checkpoint
.libPaths()


# Check which packages are installed in checkpoint library
installed.packages()


# restore initial state
uncheckpoint()


# delete the checkpoint
delete_checkpoint("2014-09-17", r_version=rver)


## End(Not run)

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The goal of checkpoint is to solve the problem of package reproducibility in R. Specifically, checkpoint allows you to install packages as they existed on CRAN on a specific snapshot date as if you had a CRAN time machine.

</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>scan_project_files</code> recursively builds a list of all the R files in your project. This includes regular R scripts, as well as Sweave files (those with extension <code>.Rnw</code>) and Rmarkdown-based files (those with extension <code>.Rmd</code>, <code>.Rpres</code> or <code>Rhtml</code>). It then parses the code in each file and looks for calls to <code>library</code> and <code>require</code>, as well as the namespacing operators <code>::</code> and <code>:::</code>. The detected packages are assumed to be available from CRAN/MRAN.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list with 2 components: <code>pkgs</code>, a vector of package names, and <code>errors</code>, a vector of files that could not be scanned. The package listing includes third-party packages, as well as those that are distributed with R and have &quot;Recommended&quot; priority. Base-priority packages (utils, graphics, methods and so forth) are not included.
</p>
<p>In addition, if any Rmarkdown files are found, the package listing will include rmarkdown. This allows you to continue rendering them in a checkpointed session.
</p>


<h3>Manifest</h3>

<p>As an <strong>experimental feature</strong>, you can specify additional packages to include or exclude via an optional <code>checkpoint.yml</code> manifest file located in your project directory. This should be a valid YAML file with 2 components:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>refs</code>: An array of package references to include in the checkpoint, that can be parsed by <code><a href="pkgdepends.html#topic+new_pkg_installation_proposal">pkgdepends::new_pkg_installation_proposal</a></code>.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>exclude</code>: An array of package names (without decorations) to exclude from the checkpoint, despite showing up in the scan.
</p>
</li></ul>

<p>A manifest file allows you to include packages from sources other than CRAN/MRAN in the checkpoint. You can include a Bioconductor package with a <code style="white-space: pre;">&#8288;bioc::&#8288;</code> reference: <code>bioc::BiocGenerics</code>. A GitHub reference begins with <code style="white-space: pre;">&#8288;github::&#8288;</code>, for example <code>github::RevolutionAnalytics/checkpoint@v1.0</code>. A <code style="white-space: pre;">&#8288;local::&#8288;</code> reference can point to a package <code>.tar.gz</code> file, or to a directory containing the package source code.
</p>
<p>You should use this feature with caution, as checkpoint does not check the versions of these packages. It's recommended that you include a version number, tag or commit hash in a reference, so that you always obtain the same version of the package. See <code><a href="pkgdepends.html#topic+pkg_refs">pkgdepends::pkg_refs</a></code> for a full description of the reference syntax; note that <code style="white-space: pre;">&#8288;installed::&#8288;</code> references are <em>not</em> currently supported by checkpoint.
</p>
<p>A use case for exclusions is if your workflow loads packages that are not on CRAN or other public repositories. For example, Microsoft Machine Learning Server (MMLS) comes with a number of proprietary packages for big data and in-database analytics. You can exclude these packages from checkpointing by listing them in the <code>exclude</code> entry in the manifest. In this case, you must ensure that your packages are still visible to the checkpointed session, for example by specifying <code>prepend=TRUE</code> in the <code>use_checkpoint</code> call. If you share your project with collaborators, they will also need to have these packages separately installed on their machines.
