<td>Description:</td>
<td>The goal of 'rFIA' is to increase the accessibility and use of the United States Forest Services (USFS) Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) Database by providing a user-friendly, open source toolkit to easily query and analyze FIA Data. Designed to accommodate a wide range of potential user objectives, 'rFIA' simplifies the estimation of forest variables from the FIA Database and allows all R users (experts and newcomers alike) to unlock the flexibility inherent to the Enhanced FIA design. Specifically, 'rFIA' improves accessibility to the spatial-temporal estimation capacity of the FIA Database by producing space-time indexed summaries of forest variables within user-defined population boundaries. Direct integration with other popular R packages (e.g., 'dplyr', 'tidyr', and 'sf') facilitates efficient space-time query and data summary, and supports common data representations and API design. The package implements design-based estimation procedures outlined by Bechtold &amp; Patterson (2005) &lt;<a href="https://doi.org/10.2737%2FSRS-GTR-80">doi:10.2737/SRS-GTR-80</a>&gt;, and has been validated against estimates and sampling errors produced by FIA 'EVALIDator'. Current development is focused on the implementation of spatially-enabled model-assisted and model-based estimators to improve population, change, and ratio estimates.</td>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p><strong>Estimation Details</strong>
</p>
<p>Estimation of forest variables follows the procedures documented in Bechtold and Patterson (2005) and <a href="https://research.fs.usda.gov/treesearch/59521">Stanke et al 2020</a>. Area percentages in the domain of interest are represented as the total number of forest plots containing trees of a particular type (live, white pine) / total number of forest plots within the region and area domain. The total populations (e.g., the denominator of the ratio estimate) used to compute these percentages will not change by changing treeDomain. Instead, specifying treeDomain will change the specific plots used to determine the total area (e.g., the numerator of the ratio estimate) that meets the given tree requirements. The total population will change if the user specifies an areaDomain or if changing landType.  
</p>
<p>Note that when using <code>grpBy</code> with a tree-level parameter (e.g., SPCD), the total area across all groups will NOT be equal to the total area of the given land type. This is because the groups are not mutually exclusive (e.g., a plot can contain more than one species and thus be counted in the area calculations for multiple SPCDs). If specifying <code>grpBy</code> with a PLOT or COND level variable (e.g., forest type [FORTYPCD]), the groups are mutually exclusive and the area across all groups will sum to the total area of the given land type. When specifying <code>grpBy</code> or <code>treeDomain</code>, percentages are calculated relative to the total amount of land area specified by <code>landType</code>. For example, if setting <code>treeDomain = SPCD == 121</code> and <code>landType = 'forest'</code>, the area percentage returned will represent the estimated percentage of forest land that contains at least one longleaf pine (<code>SPCD == 121</code>) tree.   
</p>
<p>Users may specify alternatives to the 'Temporally Indifferent' estimator using the <code>method</code> argument. Alternative design-based estimators include the annual estimator (&quot;ANNUAL&quot;; annual panels, or estimates from plots measured in the same year), simple moving average (&quot;SMA&quot;; combines annual panels with equal weight), linear moving average (&quot;LMA&quot;; combine annual panels with weights that decay <em>linearly</em> with time since measurement), and exponential moving average (&quot;EMA&quot;; combine annual panels with weights that decay <em>exponentially</em> with time since measurement). The &quot;best&quot; estimator depends entirely on user-objectives, see <a href="https://research.fs.usda.gov/treesearch/59521">Stanke et al 2020</a> for a complete description of these estimators and tradeoffs between precision and temporal specificity.
</p>
<p>When <code>byPlot = FALSE</code> (i.e., population estimates are returned), the &quot;YEAR&quot; column in the resulting dataframe indicates the final year of the inventory cycle that estimates are produced for. For example, an estimate of current forest area (e.g., 2018) may draw on data collected from 2008-2018, and &quot;YEAR&quot; will be listed as 2018 (consistent with EVALIDator). However, when <code>byPlot = TRUE</code> (i.e., plot-level estimates returned), the &quot;YEAR&quot; column denotes the year that each plot was measured (MEASYEAR), which may differ slightly from its associated inventory year (INVYR).
</p>
<p>Stratified random sampling techniques are most often employed to compute estimates in recent inventories, although double sampling and simple random sampling may be employed for early inventories. Estimates are adjusted for non-response bias by assuming attributes of non-response plot locations to be equal to the mean of other plots included within thier respective stratum or population.
</p>
<p><strong>Working with &quot;Big Data&quot;</strong>
</p>
<p>If FIA data are too large to hold in memory (e.g., R throws the &quot;cannot allocate vector of size ...&quot; errors), use larger-than-RAM options. See documentation of <code>readFIA()</code> for examples of how to set up a <code>Remote.FIA.Database</code>. As a reference, we have used rFIA's larger-than-RAM methods to estimate forest variables using the entire FIA Database (~50GB) on a standard desktop computer with 16GB of RAM. Check out <a href="https://doserlab.com/files/rfia/">our website</a> for more details and examples.
</p>
<p>Easy, efficient parallelization is implemented with the <code><a href="parallel.html#topic+parallel">parallel</a></code> package. Users must only specify the <code>nCores</code> argument with a value greater than 1 in order to implement parallel processing on their machines. Parallel implementation is achieved using a snow type cluster on any Windows OS, and with multicore forking on any Unix OS (Linux, Mac). Implementing parallel processing may substantially decrease free memory during processing, particularly on Windows OS. Thus, users should be cautious when running in parallel, and consider implementing serial processing for this task if computational resources are limited (<code>nCores = 1</code>).
</p>
<p><strong>Definition of forestland</strong>
</p>
<p>Forest land must have at least 10-percent canopy cover by live tally trees of any size, including land that formerly had such tree cover and that will be naturally or artificially regenerated. Forest land includes transition zones, such as areas between heavily forest and non-forested lands that meet the mimium tree canopy cover and forest areas adjacent to urban and built-up lands. The minimum area for classification of forest land is 1 acre in size and 120 feet wide measured stem-to-stem from the outer-most edge. Roadside, streamside, and shelterbelt strips of trees must have a width of at least 120 feet and continuous length of at least 363 feet to qualify as forest land. Tree-covered areas in agricultural production settings, such as fruit orchards, or tree-covered areas in urban settings, such as city parks, are not considered forest land.
</p>
<p>Timber land is a subset of forest land that is producing or is capable of producing crops of industrial wood and not withdrawn from timber utilization by statute or administrative regulation. (Note: Areas qualifying as timberland are capable of producing at least 20 cubic feet per acre per year of industrial wood in natural stands. Currently inaccessible and inoperable areas are NOT included).
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Dataframe or sf object (if <code>returnSpatial = TRUE</code>). If <code>byPlot = TRUE</code>, values are returned for each plot (proportion of plot in domain of interest; <code>PLOT_STATUS_CD = 1</code> when forest exists at the plot location). All variables with names ending in <code>SE</code>, represent the estimate of sampling error (%) of the variable. When <code>variance = TRUE</code>, variables ending in <code>VAR</code> denote the variance of the variable and <code>N</code> is the total sample size (i.e., including non-zero plots).
</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>YEAR</strong>: reporting year associated with estimates
</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>PERC_AREA</strong>: percent of area within the domain of interest
</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>AREA_TOTAL</strong>: estimate of total area within domain of interest (acres)
</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>nPlots_AREA_NUM</strong>: number of non-zero plots used to compute land area estimates within the domain of interest
</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>nPlots_AREA_DEN</strong>: number of non-zero plots used to compute land area estimates
</p>
</li></ul>



<h3>Note</h3>

<p>All sampling error estimates (SE) are returned as the &quot;percent coefficient of variation&quot; (standard deviation / mean * 100) for consistency with EVALIDator. IMPORTANT: sampling error cannot be used to construct confidence intervals. Please use <code>variance = TRUE</code> for that (i.e., return variance and sample size instead of sampling error).</p>

<p><strong>Estimation Details</strong>
</p>
<p>Estimation of forest variables follows the procedures documented in Bechtold and Patterson (2005) and <a href="https://research.fs.usda.gov/treesearch/59521">Stanke et al 2020</a>.
</p>
<p>Estimates are returned in terms of <em>net</em> annual change in land area by default, however users may choose to estimate components of land area change by setting <code>chngType = 'component'</code>. For example, imagine we are interested in estimating the change in forestland area across a region. During our sampling period, 4000 acres of forestland was <em>diverted</em> to non-forest and an additional 6000 acres of non-forest <em>reverted</em> to forestland. rFIA considers these shifts in land classifications change <em>components</em>, and hence these point estimates would be returned when <code>chngType = 'component'</code>. However, we are often interested in <em>net</em> change in land area, rather than individual components. Here net change in forestland area is +2000 acres (6000-4000) and represents the net result of diversion and reversion processes in the region over our study period.
</p>
<p>Users may specify alternatives to the 'Temporally Indifferent' estimator using the <code>method</code> argument. Alternative design-based estimators include the annual estimator (&quot;ANNUAL&quot;; annual panels, or estimates from plots measured in the same year), simple moving average (&quot;SMA&quot;; combines annual panels with equal weight), linear moving average (&quot;LMA&quot;; combine annual panels with weights that decay <em>linearly</em> with time since measurement), and exponential moving average (&quot;EMA&quot;; combine annual panels with weights that decay <em>exponentially</em> with time since measurement). The &quot;best&quot; estimator depends entirely on user-objectives, see <a href="https://research.fs.usda.gov/treesearch/59521">Stanke et al 2020</a> for a complete description of these estimators and tradeoffs between precision and temporal specificity.
</p>
<p>When <code>byPlot = FALSE</code> (i.e., population estimates are returned), the &quot;YEAR&quot; column in the resulting dataframe indicates the final year of the inventory cycle that estimates are produced for. For example, an estimate of current forest area (e.g., 2018) may draw on data collected from 2008-2018, and &quot;YEAR&quot; will be listed as 2018 (consistent with EVALIDator). However, when <code>byPlot = TRUE</code> (i.e., plot-level estimates returned), the &quot;YEAR&quot; column denotes the year that each plot was measured (MEASYEAR), which may differ slightly from its associated inventory year (INVYR).
</p>
<p>Stratified random sampling techniques are most often employed to compute estimates in recent inventories, although double sampling and simple random sampling may be employed for early inventories. Estimates are adjusted for non-response bias by assuming attributes of non-response plot locations to be equal to the mean of other plots included within thier respective stratum or population.
</p>
<p><strong>Working with &quot;Big Data&quot;</strong>
</p>
<p>If FIA data are too large to hold in memory (e.g., R throws the &quot;cannot allocate vector of size ...&quot; errors), use larger-than-RAM options. See documentation of <code>readFIA()</code> for examples of how to set up a <code>Remote.FIA.Database</code>. As a reference, we have used rFIA's larger-than-RAM methods to estimate forest variables using the entire FIA Database (~50GB) on a standard desktop computer with 16GB of RAM. Check out <a href="https://doserlab.com/files/rfia/">our website</a> for more details and examples.
</p>
<p>Easy, efficient parallelization is implemented with the <code><a href="parallel.html#topic+parallel">parallel</a></code> package. Users must only specify the <code>nCores</code> argument with a value greater than 1 in order to implement parallel processing on their machines. Parallel implementation is achieved using a snow type cluster on any Windows OS, and with multicore forking on any Unix OS (Linux, Mac). Implementing parallel processing may substantially decrease free memory during processing, particularly on Windows OS. Thus, users should be cautious when running in parallel, and consider implementing serial processing for this task if computational resources are limited (<code>nCores = 1</code>).
</p>
<p><strong>Definition of forestland</strong>
</p>
<p>Forest land must have at least 10-percent canopy cover by live tally trees of any size, including land that formerly had such tree cover and that will be naturally or artificially regenerated. Forest land includes transition zones, such as areas between heavily forest and non-forested lands that meet the mimium tree canopy cover and forest areas adjacent to urban and built-up lands. The minimum area for classification of forest land is 1 acre in size and 120 feet wide measured stem-to-stem from the outer-most edge. Roadside, streamside, and shelterbelt strips of trees must have a width of at least 120 feet and continuous length of at least 363 feet to qualify as forest land. Tree-covered areas in agricultural production settings, such as fruit orchards, or tree-covered areas in urban settings, such as city parks, are not considered forest land.
</p>
<p>Timber land is a subset of forest land that is producing or is capable of producing crops of industrial wood and not withdrawn from timber utilization by statute or administrative regulation. (Note: Areas qualifying as timberland are capable of producing at least 20 cubic feet per acre per year of industrial wood in natural stands. Currently inaccessible and inoperable areas are NOT included).
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Dataframe or sf object (if <code>returnSpatial = TRUE</code>). If <code>byPlot = TRUE</code>, values are returned for each plot (proportion of plot in domain of interest; <code>PLOT_STATUS_CD = 1</code> when forest exists at the plot location). All variables with names ending in <code>SE</code>, represent the estimate of sampling error (%) of the variable. When <code>variance = TRUE</code>, variables ending in <code>VAR</code> denote the variance of the variable and <code>N</code> is the total sample size (i.e., including non-zero plots).
</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>YEAR</strong>: reporting year associated with estimates
</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>PERC_CHNG</strong>: estimate of annual percent change in land area within domain of interest (% of previous)
</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>AREA_CHNG</strong>: estimate of annual change in land area within domain of interest (acres)
</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>PREV_AREA</strong>: estimate of total land area within domain of interest at first measurement (acres)
</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>nPlots</strong>: number of non-zero plots used to compute area change estimates
</p>
</li></ul>

<p>Importantly, when <code>chngType = 'component'</code>, individual change components will be returned. If no grouping variables are specified in <code>grpBy</code>, results will be grouped by variables named <strong>STATUS1</strong> and <strong>STATUS2</strong>, indicating the land classification at first and second measurements, respectively. Otherwise, if <code>grpBy</code> is specified, change components will be estimated for all shifts in land area across classified attributes represented by the variables (first and second measurements again denoted by the suffix 1 and 2). This is also the case for when additional criteria are specified to the tree, condition, or area domains using <code>treeDomain</code> and/or <code>areaDomain</code>.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>All sampling error estimates (SE) are returned as the &quot;percent coefficient of variation&quot; (standard deviation / mean * 100) for consistency with EVALIDator. IMPORTANT: sampling error cannot be used to construct confidence intervals. Please use <code>variance = TRUE</code> for that (i.e., return variance and sample size instead of sampling error).</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p><strong>Estimation Details</strong>
</p>
<p>Estimation of forest variables follows the procedures documented in Bechtold and Patterson (2005) and <a href="https://research.fs.usda.gov/treesearch/59521">Stanke et al 2020</a>. Specifically, tree biomass and carbon per acre are computed using a sample-based ratio-of-means estimator of total biomass / total land area within the domain of interest.
</p>
<p>A sum of aboveground biomass components, excluding foliage, is estimated by default (<code>component = 'AG'</code>). However, users may specify unique combinations of biomass components if they wish to do so. For example, to estimate aboveground biomass, including foliage, specify <code>component = c('AG', 'FOLIAGE')</code> in the call to <code>biomass</code>. To estimate all biomass components simultaneously (i.e., grouped by copmonent), specify <code>byComponent = TRUE</code>. All biomass components are computed using the National Scale Volume and Biomass (NSVB) approach adopted by FIA in September 2023. See <a href="https://research.fs.usda.gov/treesearch/66998">Westfall et al. 2024</a> for more detailed information on NSVB procedures. The following biomass components can be estimated using <code>biomass()</code> (note the components are not mutually exclusive):  
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><em>TOTAL</em>: total biomass, which is equivalent to the sum of the following components: &quot;ROOT&quot;, &quot;STEM&quot;, &quot;STEM_BARK&quot;, &quot;BRANCH&quot;, and &quot;FOLIAGE&quot;. <em>NOTE</em>: total carbon estimates do not include estimates of carbon in foliage.   
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><em>AG</em>: aboveground biomass/carbon, not including foliage. This is equivalent to the sum of the following components: &quot;STEM&quot;, &quot;STEM_BARK&quot;, and &quot;BRANCH&quot;.  
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><em>STEM</em>: oven-dry biomass/carbon of wood in the total stem of timber species (trees where diameter is measured at breast height) with dbh at least 1.0 inches, from ground line to the tree tip. Calculated for live and standing dead trees.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><em>STEM_BARK</em>: oven-dry biomass/carbon of bark in the total stem of timber species with dbh at least 1.0 inches, from ground line to the tree tip. Calculated for live and standing dead trees. 
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><em>BRANCH</em>: oven-dry biomass/carbon of wood and bark in the branches/limbs of timber species with at least 1.0 inches. This only includes branches; it does not include any portion of the total stem. Calculated for live and standing dead trees. For live trees, this value is reduced for broken tops. For standing dead trees, this value is reduced for broken tops as well as decay. 
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><em>FOLIAGE</em>: oven-dry biomass of foliage for live trees with dbh/drc at least 1.0 inches. <em>NOTE</em>: foliar carbon is not calculated and is instead set to 0.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><em>STUMP</em>: oven-dry biomass/carbon of wood in the stump of timber species with dbh at least 5.0 inches. The stump is that portion of the tree from the ground line to the bottom of the merchantable bole (i.e., below 1 foot). Calculated for live and standing dead trees. 
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><em>STUMP_BARK</em>:oven-dry biomass/carbon of bark in the stump of timber species with dbh at least 5.0 inches. The stump is that portion of the tree from the ground line to the bottom of the merchantable bole (i.e., below 1 foot). Calculated for live and standing dead trees.  
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><em>BOLE</em>: oven-dry biomass/carbon of wood in the merchantable bole of timber species with dbh at least 5.0 inches, from a 1-foot stump to a minimum 4-inch top diameter. Calculated for live and standing dead trees. 
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><em>BOLE_BARK</em>: oven-dry biomass/carbon of bark in the merchantable bole of timber species with dbh at least 5.0 inches, from a 1-foot stump to a minimum 4-inch top diameter. Calculated for live and standing dead trees.  
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><em>SAWLOG</em>: the oven-dry biomass/carbon of wood in the sawlog portion of timber species of sawtimber size from a 1-foot stump to a minimum top diameter or to where the central stem breaks into limbs, all of which are less than the minimum top diamter. Minimum dbh is 9.0 inches for softwoods and 11.0 inches for hardwoods. The minimum top diameter is 7.0 inches for softwoods and 9.0 inches for hardwoods. 
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><em>SAWLOG_BARK</em>: the oven-dry biomass/carbon of bark in the sawlog portion of timber species of sawtimber size from a 1-foot stump to a minimum top diameter or to where the central stem breaks into limbs, all of which are less than the minimum top diamter. Minimum dbh is 9.0 inches for softwoods and 11.0 inches for hardwoods. The minimum top diameter is 7.0 inches for softwoods and 9.0 inches for hardwoods. 
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><em>ROOT</em>: oven-dry biomass of the below ground portion of a tree, including coarse roots with a root diameter of at least 0.1 inches. This is a modeled estimate, calculated for live and standing dead trees with dbh/drc at least 1.0 inches. This component, unlike all other compoments, is estimated using the Component Ratio Method (CRM).   
</p>
</li></ul>

<p>Users may specify alternatives to the 'Temporally Indifferent' estimator using the <code>method</code> argument. Alternative design-based estimators include the annual estimator (&quot;ANNUAL&quot;; annual panels, or estimates from plots measured in the same year), simple moving average (&quot;SMA&quot;; combines annual panels with equal weight), linear moving average (&quot;LMA&quot;; combine annual panels with weights that decay <em>linearly</em> with time since measurement), and exponential moving average (&quot;EMA&quot;; combine annual panels with weights that decay <em>exponentially</em> with time since measurement). The &quot;best&quot; estimator depends entirely on user-objectives, see <a href="https://research.fs.usda.gov/treesearch/59521">Stanke et al 2020</a> for a complete description of these estimators and tradeoffs between precision and temporal specificity.
</p>
<p>When <code>byPlot = FALSE</code> (i.e., population estimates are returned), the &quot;YEAR&quot; column in the resulting dataframe indicates the final year of the inventory cycle that estimates are produced for. For example, an estimate of current forest area (e.g., 2018) may draw on data collected from 2008-2018, and &quot;YEAR&quot; will be listed as 2018 (consistent with EVALIDator). However, when <code>byPlot = TRUE</code> (i.e., plot-level estimates returned), the &quot;YEAR&quot; column denotes the year that each plot was measured (MEASYEAR), which may differ slightly from its associated inventory year (INVYR).
</p>
<p>Stratified random sampling techniques are most often employed to compute estimates in recent inventories, although double sampling and simple random sampling may be employed for early inventories. Estimates are adjusted for non-response bias by assuming attributes of non-response plot locations to be equal to the mean of other plots included within thier respective stratum or population.

<p><strong>Definition of forestland</strong>
</p>
<p>Forest land must have at least 10-percent canopy cover by live tally trees of any size, including land that formerly had such tree cover and that will be naturally or artificially regenerated. Forest land includes transition zones, such as areas between heavily forest and non-forested lands that meet the mimium tree canopy cover and forest areas adjacent to urban and built-up lands. The minimum area for classification of forest land is 1 acre in size and 120 feet wide measured stem-to-stem from the outer-most edge. Roadside, streamside, and shelterbelt strips of trees must have a width of at least 120 feet and continuous length of at least 363 feet to qualify as forest land. Tree-covered areas in agricultural production settings, such as fruit orchards, or tree-covered areas in urban settings, such as city parks, are not considered forest land.
</p>
<p>Timber land is a subset of forest land that is producing or is capable of producing crops of industrial wood and not withdrawn from timber utilization by statute or administrative regulation. (Note: Areas qualifying as timberland are capable of producing at least 20 cubic feet per acre per year of industrial wood in natural stands. Currently inaccessible and inoperable areas are NOT included).

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Produces estimates of carbon (<em>metric tonnes</em>) on a per acre basis from FIA data, along with population estimates for each variable. Estimates are consistent with those used in the EPA's Greenhouse Gas Inventory Estimates. Can be produced for regions defined within the FIA Database (e.g. counties), at the plot level, or within user-defined areal units. Options to group estimates by IPCC forest carbon pools, IPCC forest carbon components, and other variables defined in the FIADB. If multiple reporting years (EVALIDs) are included in the data, estimates will be output as a time series. If multiple states are represented by the data, estimates will be output for the full region (all area combined), unless specified otherwise (e.g. <code>grpBy = STATECD</code>).</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p><strong>Estimation Details</strong>
</p>
<p>Estimation of forest variables follows the procedures documented in Bechtold and Patterson (2005) and <a href="https://research.fs.usda.gov/treesearch/59521">Stanke et al 2020</a>. Specifically, carbon mass per acre is computed using a sample-based ratio-of-means estimator of total volume / total land area within the domain of interest.
</p>
<p>Estimation of carbon stocks draws on measured (e.g., tree carbon) and modeled attributes (e.g., soil organic carbon). This function is intended to produce estimates consistent with those in the EPA's Greenhouse Gas Inventory Estimates. Importantly, estimates are reported in <em>metric tonnes</em> - this is a key distinction relative to other <code>rFIA</code> functions, which report estimates in Imperial units. See the following for more info: http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/ghgemissions/usinventoryreport/archive.html
</p>
<p>IPCC forest carbon pools are aboveground live biomass, belowground live biomass, dead wood, litter, and soil organic carbon. Aboveground live biomass, belowground live biomass, and dead wood consist of both actual tree measurements and modeled attributes, while litter and soil organic carbon are based completely on modeled attributes. IPCC forest carbon components are defined as follows: 
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><em>AG_OVER_LIVE</em>: measured attribute. Carbon in the aboveground portion of live trees with at least 1.0 inch dbh/drc. Calculated from the FIADB TREE.CARBON_AG attribute for live trees.  
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><em>AG_UNDER_LIVE</em>: modeled attribute. Carbon in the aboveground portion of seedlings and woody shrubs. Not a direct sum of P2 or P3 measurements. Calculated from FIADB COND.CARBON_UNDERSTORY_AG attribute.  
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><em>BG_OVER_LIVE</em>: measured attribute. Carbon in the belowground portion of a tree, including coarse roots with a root diameter of at least 0.1 inch, for live trees with 1.0 inch dbh/drc. Calculated from the FIADB TREE.CARBON_BG attribute for live trees. 
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><em>BG_UNDER_LIVE</em>: modeled attribute. Carbon in the belowground portion of seedlings and woody shrubs. Not a direct sum of P2 or P3 measurements. Calculated from COND.CARBON_UNDERSTORY_BG attribute.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><em>DOWN_DEAD</em>: modeled attribute. Carbon of woody material greater than 3 inches in diameter on the ground, and stumps and their roots greater than 3 inches in diameter. Not a direct sum of P2 or P3 measurements. Calculated from FIADB COND.CARBON_DOWN_DEAD attribute.  
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><em>STAND_DEAD</em>: measured attribute. Carbon in the aboveground and belowground portion of standing dead trees with at least 1.0 inch dbh/drc. Belowground measurements include coarse roots with a root diameter of at least 0.1 inch. Calculated from the FIADB TREE.CARBON_AG and TREE.CARBON_BG columns for dead trees. <em>NOTE</em>: prior to rFIA v0.1.0, the argument <code>modelSnag</code> allowed users to specify whether this was calculated based on modeled attributes or actual tree measurements. This argument has been removed and we no longer provide the option for generating carbon in snags from modeled attributes and instead the estimates come directly from tree measurements in FIADB.  
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><em>LITTER</em>: modeled attribute. Carbon of organic material on the floor of the forest, including fine woody debris, humus, and fine roots in the organic forest floor layer above mineral soi. This is based on litter carbon observations on FIA plots, but it is not a direct sum of P2 or P3 measurements. Calculated from FIADB COND.CARBON_LITTER attribute.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><em>SOIL_ORG</em>: modeled attribute. Carbon in fine organic material below the soil surface to a depth of 1 meter. Does not include roots.  This is based on soil organic carbon observations on FIA plots, but it is not a direct sum of P2 or P3 measurements. Calculated from FIADB COND.CARBON_SOIL_ORG attribute. 
</p>
</li></ul>

<p>Users may specify alternatives to the 'Temporally Indifferent' estimator using the <code>method</code> argument. Alternative design-based estimators include the annual estimator (&quot;ANNUAL&quot;; annual panels, or estimates from plots measured in the same year), simple moving average (&quot;SMA&quot;; combines annual panels with equal weight), linear moving average (&quot;LMA&quot;; combine annual panels with weights that decay <em>linearly</em> with time since measurement), and exponential moving average (&quot;EMA&quot;; combine annual panels with weights that decay <em>exponentially</em> with time since measurement). The &quot;best&quot; estimator depends entirely on user-objectives, see <a href="https://research.fs.usda.gov/treesearch/59521">Stanke et al 2020</a> for a complete description of these estimators and tradeoffs between precision and temporal specificity.
</p>
<p>When <code>byPlot = FALSE</code> (i.e., population estimates are returned), the &quot;YEAR&quot; column in the resulting dataframe indicates the final year of the inventory cycle that estimates are produced for. For example, an estimate of current forest area (e.g., 2018) may draw on data collected from 2008-2018, and &quot;YEAR&quot; will be listed as 2018 (consistent with EVALIDator). However, when <code>byPlot = TRUE</code> (i.e., plot-level estimates returned), the &quot;YEAR&quot; column denotes the year that each plot was measured (MEASYEAR), which may differ slightly from its associated inventory year (INVYR).
</p>
<p>Stratified random sampling techniques are most often employed to compute estimates in recent inventories, although double sampling and simple random sampling may be employed for early inventories. Estimates are adjusted for non-response bias by assuming attributes of non-response plot locations to be equal to the mean of other plots included within their respective stratum or population.
</p>
<p><strong>Working with &quot;Big Data&quot;</strong>
</p>
<p>If FIA data are too large to hold in memory (e.g., R throws the &quot;cannot allocate vector of size ...&quot; errors), use larger-than-RAM options. See documentation of <code>readFIA()</code> for examples of how to set up a <code>Remote.FIA.Database</code>. As a reference, we have used rFIA's larger-than-RAM methods to estimate forest variables using the entire FIA Database (~50GB) on a standard desktop computer with 16GB of RAM. Check out <a href="https://doserlab.com/files/rfia/">our website</a> for more details and examples.
</p>
<p>Easy, efficient parallelization is implemented with the <code><a href="parallel.html#topic+parallel">parallel</a></code> package. Users must only specify the <code>nCores</code> argument with a value greater than 1 in order to implement parallel processing on their machines. Parallel implementation is achieved using a snow type cluster on any Windows OS, and with multicore forking on any Unix OS (Linux, Mac). Implementing parallel processing may substantially decrease free memory during processing, particularly on Windows OS. Thus, users should be cautious when running in parallel, and consider implementing serial processing for this task if computational resources are limited (<code>nCores = 1</code>).
</p>
<p><strong>Definition of forestland</strong>
</p>
<p>Forest land must have at least 10-percent canopy cover by live tally trees of any size, including land that formerly had such tree cover and that will be naturally or artificially regenerated. Forest land includes transition zones, such as areas between heavily forest and non-forested lands that meet the mimium tree canopy cover and forest areas adjacent to urban and built-up lands. The minimum area for classification of forest land is 1 acre in size and 120 feet wide measured stem-to-stem from the outer-most edge. Roadside, streamside, and shelterbelt strips of trees must have a width of at least 120 feet and continuous length of at least 363 feet to qualify as forest land. Tree-covered areas in agricultural production settings, such as fruit orchards, or tree-covered areas in urban settings, such as city parks, are not considered forest land.
</p>
<p>Timber land is a subset of forest land that is producing or is capable of producing crops of industrial wood and not withdrawn from timber utilization by statute or administrative regulation. (Note: Areas qualifying as timberland are capable of producing at least 20 cubic feet per acre per year of industrial wood in natural stands. Currently inaccessible and inoperable areas are NOT included).
</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Not required to run other <span class="pkg">rFIA</span> functions, but may help conserve free memory and reduce processing time if user is interested in producing estimates for a specific inventory year or within a region not explicitly described in the database (w/in user defined polygons).
</p>
<p>Spatial intersections do not adhere strictly to absolute plot locations, all plots which fall within an estimation unit (often a county) which intersects with a user defined region will be returned. The plots which fall slightly outside of the region do NOT bias estimates (removed from computations), but as FIA often employs stratified random sampling estimators, all plots within intersecting estimation units must be present to proudce unbiased variance estimates.
</p>
<p>If specifying spatio-temporal intersections on a <code>"Remote.FIA.Database"</code>, evaluation will occur state-by-state once called by an estimator function.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p><strong>Workflow and intended use cases</strong>
</p>
<p><code>customPSE</code> is intended to be used in combination with standard rFIA estimator functions, like <code>tpa()</code>, <code>area()</code>, and <code>volume()</code>, among others. Standard rFIA estimator functions generate tree- and or condition-lists for standard variables of interest (see <code>treeList</code> and <code>condList</code> arguments in estimator functions). Users may make modifications to these standard variables, for example a variable representing tree crown area may be added to a tree-list produced by <code>tpa()</code> (via some suite of allometrics). Users may then hand their modified tree-list to <code>customPSE</code> to estimate the total and proportion of forested land area in their domain of interest that is covered by tree crowns.
</p>
<p><code>customPSE</code> may be used to estimate population totals for multiple variables simultaneously (total number of trees in a region), and given a denominator variable, the associated population ratios (trees per forested acre, where forested land area is the denominator). Estimation follows the procedures documented in Bechtold and Patterson (2005) and <a href="https://research.fs.usda.gov/treesearch/59521">Stanke et al 2020</a>.
</p>
<p>Three general forms of ratio estimates may be produced: tree-tree, tree-area, and area-area ratios. For example, if tree height is specified as the numerator variable (adjusted for sampling area by multiplying by TPA), and TPA is specified as the denominator variable, a tree-tree ratio will be produced that represents the height of the average tree within a region of interest. Similarly, if stand age is specified as the numerator (adjusted for sampling area by proportionate area of the forested condition on the plot, i.e., <code>PROP_FOREST</code>), and the proportion area of the plot that is forested is specified as the denominator, an area-area ratio will be produced that represents average stand age within the region of interest. Tree-area ratios are more familiar, such as trees per acre, tree biomass per acre, etc, where a tree variable is specified as the numerator, and proportion of plot area occupied by forestland is the denominator. See our website for detailed examples of each of these ratio estimates.
</p>
<p><strong>Input requirements</strong>
</p>
<p>Estimation of tree variables require the following columns be present in <code>x</code> and/or <code>y</code>: PLT_CN, EVAL_TYP, SUBP, TREE, and TREE_BASIS. Similarly, estimation of area variables require the following columns be present in <code>x</code> and/or <code>y</code>: PLT_CN, EVAL_TYP, CONDID, and AREA_BASIS. Each of these required variables will be returned in tree- and condition-lists generated by standard rFIA estimator functions.
</p>
<p>IMPORTANT: Only one of TREE_BASIS or AREA_BASIS may be present <code>x</code> or <code>y</code>, as the presence of these columns are used to determine if variables to be estimated are tree variables or area variables. Some standard rFIA estimator functions will produce tree-lists with both TREE_BASIS and AREA_BASIS listed in output, as the tree-list will contain tree variables (e.g., TPA, BAA) as well as area variables (e.g., PROP_FOREST, proportion of plot represented by the forested condition where each tree is growing)). To produce a tree-area ratio with such an output, AREA_BASIS must be removed from the data.frame specified in <code>x</code>, and TREE_BASIS must be removed from that specified in <code>y</code>.
</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Produces estimates of diversity from FIA data. Returns Shannon's index, Shannon's equitability, and richness for alpha (mean/SE of stands), beta, and gamma diversity. Default behavior estimates species diversity, using <code>TPA_UNADJ</code> (trees per acre) as a state variable and <code>SPCD</code> (species) to groups of individuals. Estimates can be produced for regions defined within the FIA Database (e.g. counties), at the plot level, or within user-defined areal units. Options to group estimates by size class and other variables defined in the FIADB. If multiple reporting years (EVALIDs) are included in the data, estimates will be output as a time series. If multiple states are represented by the data, estimates will be output for the full region (all area combined), unless specified otherwise (e.g. <code>grpBy = STATECD</code>).

<h3>Details</h3>

<p><strong>Estimation Details</strong>
</p>
<p>Estimation of forest variables follows the procedures documented in Bechtold and Patterson (2005) and <a href="https://research.fs.usda.gov/treesearch/59521">Stanke et al 2020</a>. Procedures for computing diversity indices are outlined in Hill (1973) and Shannon (1948).
</p>
<p>Alpha-level indices are computed as the mean diversity of a stand. Specifically, alpha diversity is estimated using a sample-based ratio-of-means estimator of stand diversity (e.g. Richness) * land area of stand / total land area within the domain of interest. Thus estimates of alpha diversity within a stand are weighted by the area that stand represents. Gamma-level diversity is computed as a regional index, pooling all plot data together. Beta diversity is computed as gamma diversity - alpha diversity, and thus represents the excess of regional diversity with respect to local diversity.
</p>
<p>Users may specify alternatives to the 'Temporally Indifferent' estimator using the <code>method</code> argument. Alternative design-based estimators include the annual estimator (&quot;ANNUAL&quot;; annual panels, or estimates from plots measured in the same year), simple moving average (&quot;SMA&quot;; combines annual panels with equal weight), linear moving average (&quot;LMA&quot;; combine annual panels with weights that decay <em>linearly</em> with time since measurement), and exponential moving average (&quot;EMA&quot;; combine annual panels with weights that decay <em>exponentially</em> with time since measurement). The &quot;best&quot; estimator depends entirely on user-objectives, see <a href="https://research.fs.usda.gov/treesearch/59521">Stanke et al 2020</a> for a complete description of these estimators and tradeoffs between precision and temporal specificity.
</p>
<p>When <code>byPlot = FALSE</code> (i.e., population estimates are returned), the &quot;YEAR&quot; column in the resulting dataframe indicates the final year of the inventory cycle that estimates are produced for. For example, an estimate of current forest area (e.g., 2018) may draw on data collected from 2008-2018, and &quot;YEAR&quot; will be listed as 2018 (consistent with EVALIDator). However, when <code>byPlot = TRUE</code> (i.e., plot-level estimates returned), the &quot;YEAR&quot; column denotes the year that each plot was measured (MEASYEAR), which may differ slightly from its associated inventory year (INVYR).
</p>
<p>Stratified random sampling techniques are most often employed to compute estimates in recent inventories, although double sampling and simple random sampling may be employed for early inventories. Estimates are adjusted for non-response bias by assuming attributes of non-response plot locations to be equal to the mean of other plots included within thier respective stratum or population.
</p>
<p><strong>Working with &quot;Big Data&quot;</strong>
</p>
<p>If FIA data are too large to hold in memory (e.g., R throws the &quot;cannot allocate vector of size ...&quot; error), use larger-than-RAM options. See documentation of <code>link{readFIA}</code> for examples of how to set up a <code>Remote.FIA.Database</code>. As a reference, we have used rFIA's larger-than-RAM methods to estimate forest variables using the entire FIA Database (~50GB) on a standard desktop computer with 16GB of RAM. Check out <a href="https://doserlab.com/files/rfia/">our website</a> for more details and examples.
</p>
<p>Easy, efficient parallelization is implemented with the <code><a href="parallel.html#topic+parallel">parallel</a></code> package. Users must only specify the <code>nCores</code> argument with a value greater than 1 in order to implement parallel processing on their machines. Parallel implementation is achieved using a snow type cluster on any Windows OS, and with multicore forking on any Unix OS (Linux, Mac). Implementing parallel processing may substantially decrease free memory during processing, particularly on Windows OS. Thus, users should be cautious when running in parallel, and consider implementing serial processing for this task if computational resources are limited (<code>nCores = 1</code>).
</p>
<p><strong>Definition of forestland</strong>
</p>
<p>Forest land must have at least 10-percent canopy cover by live tally trees of any size, including land that formerly had such tree cover and that will be naturally or artificially regenerated. Forest land includes transition zones, such as areas between heavily forest and non-forested lands that meet the mimium tree canopy cover and forest areas adjacent to urban and built-up lands. The minimum area for classification of forest land is 1 acre in size and 120 feet wide measured stem-to-stem from the outer-most edge. Roadside, streamside, and shelterbelt strips of trees must have a width of at least 120 feet and continuous length of at least 363 feet to qualify as forest land. Tree-covered areas in agricultural production settings, such as fruit orchards, or tree-covered areas in urban settings, such as city parks, are not considered forest land.
</p>
<p>Timber land is a subset of forest land that is producing or is capable of producing crops of industrial wood and not withdrawn from timber utilization by statute or administrative regulation. (Note: Areas qualifying as timberland are capable of producing at least 20 cubic feet per acre per year of industrial wood in natural stands.

<h2 id='dwm'>Estimate volume, biomass, and carbon stocks of down woody material (fuels) from FIADB
</h2><span id='topic+dwm'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Produces estimates of down woody material stocks on a per acre basis from the Forest Inventory and Analysis Database (FIADB), along with population totals for each variable. Estimates can be returned by fuel class (duff, litter, 1HR, 10HR, 100HR, 1000HR, piles) for application in fuels management. Estimates can be produced for regions defined within the FIA Database (e.g. counties), at the plot level, or within user-defined areal units. If multiple reporting years (EVALIDs) are included in the data, estimates will be output as a time series. If multiple states are represented by the data, estimates will be output for the full region (all area combined), unless specified otherwise (e.g. <code>grpBy = STATECD</code>).

<h3>Details</h3>

<p><strong>Estimation Details</strong>
</p>
<p>Estimation of forest variables follows the procedures documented in Bechtold and Patterson (2005) and <a href="https://research.fs.usda.gov/treesearch/59521">Stanke et al 2020</a>. Specifically, per acre estimates are computed using a sample-based ratio-of-means estimator of total volume (biomass or carbon) / total land area within the domain of interest.
</p>
<p>As defined by FIA, down woody material includes dead organic materials (resulting from plant mortality and leaf turnover) and fuel complexes of live shrubs and herbs. To maintain relevance for forest fuels management, we by default report estimates grouped by fuel lag-time classes. Specifically, we report estimates for 1HR fuels (small, fine woody debris), 10HR fuels (medium, fine woody debris), 100HR fuels (large, fine woody debris), 1000HR fuels (coarse woody debris), and slash piles, in addition to duff (O horizon; all unidentifiable organic material above mineral soil, beneath litter) and litter (identifiable plant material which is downed and smaller than 10HR fuel class (1HR class includes standing herbaceous material). See Woodall and Monleon (2007) for definitions of fuel lag-time classes and for details on sampling and estimation procedures.
</p>
<p>Users may specify alternatives to the 'Temporally Indifferent' estimator using the <code>method</code> argument. Alternative design-based estimators include the annual estimator (&quot;ANNUAL&quot;; annual panels, or estimates from plots measured in the same year), simple moving average (&quot;SMA&quot;; combines annual panels with equal weight), linear moving average (&quot;LMA&quot;; combine annual panels with weights that decay <em>linearly</em> with time since measurement), and exponential moving average (&quot;EMA&quot;; combine annual panels with weights that decay <em>exponentially</em> with time since measurement). The &quot;best&quot; estimator depends entirely on user-objectives, see <a href="https://research.fs.usda.gov/treesearch/59521">Stanke et al 2020</a> for a complete description of these estimators and tradeoffs between precision and temporal specificity.
</p>
<p>When <code>byPlot = FALSE</code> (i.e., population estimates are returned), the &quot;YEAR&quot; column in the resulting dataframe indicates the final year of the inventory cycle that estimates are produced for. For example, an estimate of current forest area (e.g., 2018) may draw on data collected from 2008-2018, and &quot;YEAR&quot; will be listed as 2018 (consistent with EVALIDator). However, when <code>byPlot = TRUE</code> (i.e., plot-level estimates returned), the &quot;YEAR&quot; column denotes the year that each plot was measured (MEASYEAR), which may differ slightly from its associated inventory year (INVYR).
</p>
<p>Stratified random sampling techniques are most often employed to compute estimates in recent inventories, although double sampling and simple random sampling may be employed for early inventories. Estimates are adjusted for non-response bias by assuming attributes of non-response plot locations to be equal to the mean of other plots included within thier respective stratum or population.
</p>
<p><strong>Working with &quot;Big Data&quot;</strong>
</p>
<p>If FIA data are too large to hold in memory (e.g., R throws the &quot;cannot allocate vector of size ...&quot; errors), use larger-than-RAM options. See documentation of <code>link{readFIA}</code> for examples of how to set up a <code>Remote.FIA.Database</code>. As a reference, we have used rFIA's larger-than-RAM methods to estimate forest variables using the entire FIA Database (~50GB) on a standard desktop computer with 16GB of RAM. Check out <a href="https://doserlab.com/files/rfia/">our website</a> for more details and examples.
</p>
<p>Easy, efficient parallelization is implemented with the <code><a href="parallel.html#topic+parallel">parallel</a></code> package. Users must only specify the <code>nCores</code> argument with a value greater than 1 in order to implement parallel processing on their machines. Parallel implementation is achieved using a snow type cluster on any Windows OS, and with multicore forking on any Unix OS (Linux, Mac). Implementing parallel processing may substantially decrease free memory during processing, particularly on Windows OS. Thus, users should be cautious when running in parallel, and consider implementing serial processing for this task if computational resources are limited (<code>nCores = 1</code>).
</p>
<p><strong>Definition of forestland</strong>
</p>
<p>Forest land must have at least 10-percent canopy cover by live tally trees of any size, including land that formerly had such tree cover and that will be naturally or artificially regenerated. Forest land includes transition zones, such as areas between heavily forest and non-forested lands that meet the mimium tree canopy cover and forest areas adjacent to urban and built-up lands. The minimum area for classification of forest land is 1 acre in size and 120 feet wide measured stem-to-stem from the outer-most edge. Roadside, streamside, and shelterbelt strips of trees must have a width of at least 120 feet and continuous length of at least 363 feet to qualify as forest land. Tree-covered areas in agricultural production settings, such as fruit orchards, or tree-covered areas in urban settings, such as city parks, are not considered forest land.
</p>
<p>Timber land is a subset of forest land that is producing or is capable of producing crops of industrial wood and not withdrawn from timber utilization by statute or administrative regulation. (Note: Areas qualifying as timberland are capable of producing at least 20 cubic feet per acre per year of industrial wood in natural stands. Currently inaccessible and inoperable areas are NOT included).
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Dataframe or sf object (if <code>returnSpatial = TRUE</code>). If <code>byPlot = TRUE</code>, values are returned for each plot (<code>PLOT_STATUS_CD = 1</code> when forest exists at the plot location). All variables with names ending in <code>SE</code>, represent the estimate of sampling error (%) of the variable. When <code>variance = TRUE</code>, variables ending in <code>VAR</code> denote the variance of the variable and <code>N</code> is the total sample size (i.e., including non-zero plots).
</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>YEAR</strong>: reporting year associated with estimates
</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>FUEL_TYPE</strong>: fuel type associated with each row
</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>VOL_ACRE</strong>: estimate of mean volume per acre of dwm (cu.ft/acre)
</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>BIO_ACRE</strong>: estimate of mean biomass per acre of dwm (short tons/acre)
</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>CARB_ACRE</strong>: estimate of mean carbon mass per acre of dwm (short tons/acre)
</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>nPlots</strong>: number of non-zero plots used to compute estimates
</p>
</li></ul>



<h3>Note</h3>

<p>All sampling error estimates (SE) are returned as the &quot;percent coefficient of variation&quot; (standard deviation / mean * 100) for consistency with EVALIDator. IMPORTANT: sampling error cannot be used to construct confidence intervals. Please use <code>variance = TRUE</code> for that (i.e., return variance and sample size instead of sampling error).</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>EVALIDs in the FIA Database are used to reference data points associated with particular inventory years and evaluation types within a state (e.g. 2017 Current Volume in Michigan). They are often extraordinarily confusing for those not familiar for the FIA Database. With this in mind, <span class="pkg">rFIA</span> has been designed to eliminate users dependence on identifying and specifying appropriate EVALIDs to produce desired estimates, and we therefore do not recommend users attempt to identify EVALIDs independently.
</p>
<p>Any <code>state</code> or <code>year</code> specified must be present in <code>db</code> to return associated EVALIDS.
</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p><strong>Estimation Details</strong>
</p>
<p>Estimation of forest variables follows the procedures documented in Bechtold and Patterson (2005) and <a href="https://research.fs.usda.gov/treesearch/59521">Stanke et al 2020</a>.
</p>
<p>Please see Stanke et al. 2021 (doi: 10.1038/s41467-020-20678-z) for a complete description of the Forest Stability Index (FSI). In short, the FSI is a direct measure of temporal change in the relative density of live trees, where relative density is defined as the ratio of observed tree density to maximum potential tree density. Maximum potential tree density is modeled as a power function of average tree size - in the current implementation average tree basal area is used. Users may allow both the &quot;slopes&quot; and intercepts of this power function to vary by classified groups, like forest community type using the <code>scaleBy</code> argument. Users may return the estimated parameters of maximum size-density models by specifying <code>returnBetas = TRUE</code>.
</p>
<p>Users may specify alternatives to the 'Temporally Indifferent' estimator using the <code>method</code> argument. Alternative design-based estimators include the annual estimator (&quot;ANNUAL&quot;; annual panels, or estimates from plots measured in the same year), simple moving average (&quot;SMA&quot;; combines annual panels with equal weight), linear moving average (&quot;LMA&quot;; combine annual panels with weights that decay <em>linearly</em> with time since measurement), and exponential moving average (&quot;EMA&quot;; combine annual panels with weights that decay <em>exponentially</em> with time since measurement). The &quot;best&quot; estimator depends entirely on user-objectives, see <a href="https://research.fs.usda.gov/treesearch/59521">Stanke et al 2020</a> for a complete description of these estimators and tradeoffs between precision and temporal specificity.
</p>
<p>When <code>byPlot = FALSE</code> (i.e., population estimates are returned), the &quot;YEAR&quot; column in the resulting dataframe indicates the final year of the inventory cycle that estimates are produced for. For example, an estimate of current forest area (e.g., 2018) may draw on data collected from 2008-2018, and &quot;YEAR&quot; will be listed as 2018 (consistent with EVALIDator). However, when <code>byPlot = TRUE</code> (i.e., plot-level estimates returned), the &quot;YEAR&quot; column denotes the year that each plot was measured (MEASYEAR), which may differ slightly from its associated inventory year (INVYR).
</p>
<p>Stratified random sampling techniques are most often employed to compute estimates in recent inventories, although double sampling and simple random sampling may be employed for early inventories. Estimates are adjusted for non-response bias by assuming attributes of non-response plot locations to be equal to the mean of other plots included within their respective stratum or population.
</p>
<p><strong>Working with &quot;Big Data&quot;</strong>
</p>
<p>If FIA data are too large to hold in memory (e.g., R throws the &quot;cannot allocate vector of size ...&quot; errors), use larger-than-RAM options. See documentation of <code>link{readFIA}</code> for examples of how to set up a <code>Remote.FIA.Database</code>. As a reference, we have used rFIA's larger-than-RAM methods to estimate forest variables using the entire FIA Database (~50GB) on a standard desktop computer with 16GB of RAM. Check out <a href="https://doserlab.com/files/rfia/">our website</a> for more details and examples.
</p>
<p>Easy, efficient parallelization is implemented with the <code><a href="parallel.html#topic+parallel">parallel</a></code> package. Users must only specify the <code>nCores</code> argument with a value greater than 1 in order to implement parallel processing on their machines. Parallel implementation is achieved using a snow type cluster on any Windows OS, and with multicore forking on any Unix OS (Linux, Mac). Implementing parallel processing may substantially decrease free memory during processing, particularly on Windows OS. Thus, users should be cautious when running in parallel, and consider implementing serial processing for this task if computational resources are limited (<code>nCores = 1</code>).
</p>
<p><strong>Definition of forestland</strong>
</p>
<p>Forest land must have at least 10-percent canopy cover by live tally trees of any size, including land that formerly had such tree cover and that will be naturally or artificially regenerated. Forest land includes transition zones, such as areas between heavily forest and non-forested lands that meet the mimium tree canopy cover and forest areas adjacent to urban and built-up lands. The minimum area for classification of forest land is 1 acre in size and 120 feet wide measured stem-to-stem from the outer-most edge. Roadside, streamside, and shelterbelt strips of trees must have a width of at least 120 feet and continuous length of at least 363 feet to qualify as forest land. Tree-covered areas in agricultural production settings, such as fruit orchards, or tree-covered areas in urban settings, such as city parks, are not considered forest land.
</p>
<p>Timber land is a subset of forest land that is producing or is capable of producing crops of industrial wood and not withdrawn from timber utilization by statute or administrative regulation. (Note: Areas qualifying as timberland are capable of producing at least 20 cubic feet per acre per year of industrial wood in natural stands. Currently inaccessible and inoperable areas are NOT included).
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>When <code>returnBetas = TRUE</code>, a list will be returned. This list will contain a dataframe named &quot;results&quot;, containing estimates of the FSI, and another named &quot;betas&quot;, containing estimated parameters of the maximum size-density model. When <code>returnBetas = FALSE</code>, a data.frame corresponding with &quot;results&quot; will be returned.
</p>
<p><strong>Results</strong> Dataframe or sf object (if <code>returnSpatial = TRUE</code>). If <code>byPlot = TRUE</code>, values are returned for each plot (<code>PLOT_STATUS_CD = 1</code> when forest exists at the plot location). All variables with names ending in <code>SE</code>, represent the estimate of sampling error (%) of the variable. When <code>variance = TRUE</code>, variables ending in <code>VAR</code> denote the variance of the variable and <code>N</code> is the total sample size (i.e., including non-zero plots).
</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>YEAR</strong>: reporting year associated with estimates
</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>FSI</strong>: estimate of forest stability index (i.e., annual change in relative live tree density)

</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>BA_RATE</strong>: standardized estimate of annual change in BA (proportionate change)
</p>
</li></ul>

<p><strong>Betas</strong> Within betas, all variable names ending in &quot;upper&quot; or &quot;lower&quot; represent the upper and lower bounds of the 95% Bayesian credible interval of their respective variables. All variable names beginning with &quot;fixed&quot; represent the fixed effects in random slope/intercept models (i.e., the global average).
</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>grps</strong>: unique identifier associated with the group (i.e., unique combination of variables listed in <code>scaleBy</code>).
</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>alpha</strong>: posterior median of scaling factor that describes the maximum tree density at average tree basal area of one sq. ft.
</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>rate</strong>: posterior median of negative exponent controlling the decay in maximum tree density with increasing average tree size.
</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>n</strong>: number of observations with the group with an approximately normal diameter distribution and no evidence of recent disturbance.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h3>Note</h3>

<p>All sampling error estimates (SE) are returned as the &quot;percent coefficient of variation&quot; (standard deviation / mean * 100) for consistency with EVALIDator. IMPORTANT: sampling error cannot be used to construct confidence intervals. Please use <code>variance = TRUE</code> for that (i.e., return variance and sample size instead of sampling error).</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The FIA database is not limited for use with standard design-based estimators. A plethora of recent work has highlighted the improvements that model-assisted and model-based estimators can provide relative to the standard post-stratified estimators implemented in <code>rFIA</code>. However, when implementing alternative model-assisted or model-based estimators it is important to accommodate the design information for post-stratified FIA inventories. <code>getDesignInfo()</code> allows you to quickly extract design-based information for use when implementing alternative estimators with FIA data. See the Stanke et al. 2021 reference below for a paper describing use of <code>rFIA</code> for implementing model-based estimators to improve small area estimation of forest parameters. 
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Generates a data frame with the columns described below, containing the design information associated with one or multiple FIA inventories.
</p>
<p>For reference, there are often multiple non-overlapping estimation units within a state, and multiple, non-overlapping, and exhaustive strata within each estimation unit. Estimation unit and strata boundaries vary with inventories (i.e., by reporting year and by inventory type), though multiple inventories may draw from data collected at a single plot visit. Hence, ESTN_UNIT_CN and STRATUM_CN are specific to EVALIDs (or alternatively, the combination of STATE, YEAR, and EVAL_TYP, for all states except Texas). However, a single PLT_CN may be associated with multiple ESTN_UNIT_CNs and STRATUM_CNs.
</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>STATECD</strong>: unique identifier for states.
</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>YEAR</strong>: reporting year associated with estimates (END_INVYR from POP_EVAL).
</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>EVAL_TYP</strong>: an identifier describing the type of evaluation. For example, &quot;EXPDWM&quot; represents sampled plots used for down woody material estimates.
</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>EVALID</strong>: unique identifier that represents the population used to produce a type of estimate.
</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>ESTN_UNIT_CN</strong>: unique identifier for estimation unit.
</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>AREA_USED</strong>: area of estimation unit used for population estimation.
</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>STRATUM_CN</strong>: unique identifier for strata.

</li>
<li><p><strong>STRATUM_WGT</strong>: proportion of estimation unit area (AREA_USED) that is occupied by a particular stratum. Defined on the range (0,1].
</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>If <code>common = TRUE</code>, the following tables will be loaded: COND, COND_DWM_CALC, INVASIVE_SUBPLOT_SPP, PLOT, POP_ESTN_UNIT, POP_EVAL, POP_EVAL_GRP, POP_EVAL_TYP, POP_PLOT_STRATUM_ASSGN, POP_STRATUM, SUBPLOT, TREE, TREE_GRM_COMPONENT, TREE_GRM_MIDPT, TREE_GRM_BEGIN, SUBP_COND_CHNG_MTRX, SEEDLING, SURVEY, SUBP_COND, P2VEG_SUBP_STRUCTURE. These tables currently support all functionality with <code>rFIA</code>, and it is recommended that only these tables be imported to conserve RAM and reduce processing time.
</p>
<p>If you wish to merge multiple state downloads of FIA data (e.g. Michigan and Indiana state downloads), simply specify multiple state abbreviations to the <code>states</code> argument. Upon import, corresponding tables (e.g. MI_PLOT and IN_PLOT) will be merged, and analysis can be completed for the entire region or within spatial units which transcend state boundaries (e.g. Ecoregion subsections).
</p>
<p>If you choose to save downloaded tables to a local directory after download (simply specify <code>dir</code>), these tables can be easily reloaded into R using <code>readFIA()</code> (do not need to redownload files).
</p>
<p>Easy, efficient parallelization is implemented with the <code><a href="parallel.html#topic+parallel">parallel</a></code> package. Users must only specify the <code>nCores</code> argument with a value greater than 1 in order to implement parallel processing on their machines.

<h2 id='growMort'>Estimate growth, recruitment, mortality, and harvest rates from FIADB</h2><span id='topic+growMort'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Produces estimates of annual growth, recruitment, natural mortality, and harvest rates from the Forest Inventory and Analysis Database (FIADB), along with population estimates for each variable. Estimates can be produced for regions defined within the FIA Database (e.g. counties), at the plot level, or within user-defined areal units. Options to group estimates by species, size class, and other variables defined in the FIADB. If multiple reporting years (EVALIDs) are included in the data, estimates will be output as a time series. If multiple states are represented by the data, estimates will be output for the full region (all area combined), unless specified otherwise (e.g. <code>grpBy = STATECD</code>). </p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p><strong>Estimation Details</strong>
</p>
<p>Estimation of forest variables follows the procedures documented in Bechtold and Patterson (2005) and <a href="https://research.fs.usda.gov/treesearch/59521">Stanke et al 2020</a>.
</p>
<p>Average annual rates are computed using a sample-based ratio of means estimator of total trees subject to an event (e.g. recruitment, mortality) annually / total area. Similarly, the proportion of individuals subject to each event annually is computed as the total trees subject to the event between time 1 and time 2 / total live trees at time 1. All estimates are returned as average annual rates. Only conditions which were forested in time 1 and in time 2 are included in estimates (excluding converted stands).
</p>
<p>Recruitment events are defined as when a live stem that is less than 5 inches DBH at time 1, grows to or beyond 5 inches DBH by time 2. This does NOT include stems that grow beyond the 5-inch diameter criteria and are then subject to mortality (both natural and harvest) prior to remeasurement. Natural mortality is defined as when a live stem is subject to non-harvest mortality between successive measurement periods. Finally, harvest is defined as when a live stem is cut and removed between successive measurements.
</p>
<p>Users may specify alternatives to the 'Temporally Indifferent' estimator using the <code>method</code> argument. Alternative design-based estimators include the annual estimator (&quot;ANNUAL&quot;; annual panels, or estimates from plots measured in the same year), simple moving average (&quot;SMA&quot;; combines annual panels with equal weight), linear moving average (&quot;LMA&quot;; combine annual panels with weights that decay <em>linearly</em> with time since measurement), and exponential moving average (&quot;EMA&quot;; combine annual panels with weights that decay <em>exponentially</em> with time since measurement). The &quot;best&quot; estimator depends entirely on user-objectives, see <a href="https://research.fs.usda.gov/treesearch/59521">Stanke et al 2020</a> for a complete description of these estimators and tradeoffs between precision and temporal specificity.
</p>
<p>When <code>byPlot = FALSE</code> (i.e., population estimates are returned), the &quot;YEAR&quot; column in the resulting dataframe indicates the final year of the inventory cycle that estimates are produced for. For example, an estimate of current forest area (e.g., 2018) may draw on data collected from 2008-2018, and &quot;YEAR&quot; will be listed as 2018 (consistent with EVALIDator). However, when <code>byPlot = TRUE</code> (i.e., plot-level estimates returned), the &quot;YEAR&quot; column denotes the year that each plot was measured (MEASYEAR), which may differ slightly from its associated inventory year (INVYR).
</p>
<p>Stratified random sampling techniques are most often employed to compute estimates in recent inventories, although double sampling and simple random sampling may be employed for early inventories. Estimates are adjusted for non-response bias by assuming attributes of non-response plot locations to be equal to the mean of other plots included within thier respective stratum or population.
</p>
<p><strong>Working with &quot;Big Data&quot;</strong>
</p>
<p>If FIA data are too large to hold in memory (e.g., R throws the &quot;cannot allocate vector of size ...&quot; errors), use larger-than-RAM options. See documentation of <code>link{readFIA}</code> for examples of how to set up a <code>Remote.FIA.Database</code>. As a reference, we have used rFIA's larger-than-RAM methods to estimate forest variables using the entire FIA Database (~50GB) on a standard desktop computer with 16GB of RAM. Check out <a href="https://doserlab.com/files/rfia/">our website</a> for more details and examples.
</p>
<p>Easy, efficient parallelization is implemented with the <code><a href="parallel.html#topic+parallel">parallel</a></code> package. Users must only specify the <code>nCores</code> argument with a value greater than 1 in order to implement parallel processing on their machines. Parallel implementation is achieved using a snow type cluster on any Windows OS, and with multicore forking on any Unix OS (Linux, Mac). Implementing parallel processing may substantially decrease free memory during processing, particularly on Windows OS. Thus, users should be cautious when running in parallel, and consider implementing serial processing for this task if computational resources are limited (<code>nCores = 1</code>).
</p>
<p><strong>Definition of forestland</strong>
</p>
<p>Forest land must have at least 10-percent canopy cover by live tally trees of any size, including land that formerly had such tree cover and that will be naturally or artificially regenerated. Forest land includes transition zones, such as areas between heavily forest and non-forested lands that meet the mimium tree canopy cover and forest areas adjacent to urban and built-up lands. The minimum area for classification of forest land is 1 acre in size and 120 feet wide measured stem-to-stem from the outer-most edge. Roadside, streamside, and shelterbelt strips of trees must have a width of at least 120 feet and continuous length of at least 363 feet to qualify as forest land. Tree-covered areas in agricultural production settings, such as fruit orchards, or tree-covered areas in urban settings, such as city parks, are not considered forest land.
</p>
<p>Timber land is a subset of forest land that is producing or is capable of producing crops of industrial wood and not withdrawn from timber utilization by statute or administrative regulation. (Note: Areas qualifying as timberland are capable of producing at least 20 cubic feet per acre per year of industrial wood in natural stands. Currently inaccessible and inoperable areas are NOT included).
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Dataframe or sf object (if <code>returnSpatial = TRUE</code>). If <code>byPlot = TRUE</code>, values are returned for each plot (<code>PLOT_STATUS_CD = 1</code> when forest exists at the plot location). All variables with names ending in <code>SE</code>, represent the estimate of sampling error (%) of the variable. When <code>variance = TRUE</code>, variables ending in <code>VAR</code> denote the variance of the variable and <code>N</code> is the total sample size (i.e., including non-zero plots).

<h3>Note</h3>

<p>All sampling error estimates (SE) are returned as the &quot;percent coefficient of variation&quot; (standard deviation / mean * 100) for consistency with EVALIDator. IMPORTANT: sampling error cannot be used to construct confidence intervals. Please use <code>variance = TRUE</code> for that (i.e., return variance and sample size instead of sampling error).</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p><strong>Estimation Details</strong>
</p>
<p>Estimation of forest variables follows the procedures documented in Bechtold and Patterson (2005) and <a href="https://research.fs.usda.gov/treesearch/59521">Stanke et al 2020</a>.
</p>
<p>Specifically, percent areal coverage is computed using a sample-based ratio-of-means estimator of total invasive coverage area / total land area within the domain of interest. Estimates of areal coverage of individual invasive species should NOT be summed to produce estimates of areal coverage by ALL invasive species, as areal coverage by species is not mutually exclusive (multiple species may occur in the same area). Current FIA data collection protocols do not allow for the unbiased estimation of areal coverage by all invasive species.
</p>
<p>Users may specify alternatives to the 'Temporally Indifferent' estimator using the <code>method</code> argument. Alternative design-based estimators include the annual estimator (&quot;ANNUAL&quot;; annual panels, or estimates from plots measured in the same year), simple moving average (&quot;SMA&quot;; combines annual panels with equal weight), linear moving average (&quot;LMA&quot;; combine annual panels with weights that decay <em>linearly</em> with time since measurement), and exponential moving average (&quot;EMA&quot;; combine annual panels with weights that decay <em>exponentially</em> with time since measurement). The &quot;best&quot; estimator depends entirely on user-objectives, see <a href="https://research.fs.usda.gov/treesearch/59521">Stanke et al 2020</a> for a complete description of these estimators and tradeoffs between precision and temporal specificity.
</p>
<p>When <code>byPlot = FALSE</code> (i.e., population estimates are returned), the &quot;YEAR&quot; column in the resulting dataframe indicates the final year of the inventory cycle that estimates are produced for. For example, an estimate of current forest area (e.g., 2018) may draw on data collected from 2008-2018, and &quot;YEAR&quot; will be listed as 2018 (consistent with EVALIDator). However, when <code>byPlot = TRUE</code> (i.e., plot-level estimates returned), the &quot;YEAR&quot; column denotes the year that each plot was measured (MEASYEAR), which may differ slightly from its associated inventory year (INVYR).
</p>
<p>Stratified random sampling techniques are most often employed to compute estimates in recent inventories, although double sampling and simple random sampling may be employed for early inventories. Estimates are adjusted for non-response bias by assuming attributes of non-response plot locations to be equal to the mean of other plots included within thier respective stratum or population.
</p>
<p><strong>Working with &quot;Big Data&quot;</strong>
</p>
<p>If FIA data are too large to hold in memory (e.g., R throws the &quot;cannot allocate vector of size ...&quot; errors), use larger-than-RAM options. See documentation of <code>link{readFIA}</code> for examples of how to set up a <code>Remote.FIA.Database</code>. As a reference, we have used rFIA's larger-than-RAM methods to estimate forest variables using the entire FIA Database (~50GB) on a standard desktop computer with 16GB of RAM. Check out <a href="https://doserlab.com/files/rfia/">our website</a> for more details and examples.
</p>
<p>Easy, efficient parallelization is implemented with the <code><a href="parallel.html#topic+parallel">parallel</a></code> package. Users must only specify the <code>nCores</code> argument with a value greater than 1 in order to implement parallel processing on their machines. Parallel implementation is achieved using a snow type cluster on any Windows OS, and with multicore forking on any Unix OS (Linux, Mac). Implementing parallel processing may substantially decrease free memory during processing, particularly on Windows OS. Thus, users should be cautious when running in parallel, and consider implementing serial processing for this task if computational resources are limited (<code>nCores = 1</code>).
</p>
<p><strong>Definition of forestland</strong>
</p>
<p>Forest land must have at least 10-percent canopy cover by live tally trees of any size, including land that formerly had such tree cover and that will be naturally or artificially regenerated. Forest land includes transition zones, such as areas between heavily forest and non-forested lands that meet the mimium tree canopy cover and forest areas adjacent to urban and built-up lands. The minimum area for classification of forest land is 1 acre in size and 120 feet wide measured stem-to-stem from the outer-most edge. Roadside, streamside, and shelterbelt strips of trees must have a width of at least 120 feet and continuous length of at least 363 feet to qualify as forest land. Tree-covered areas in agricultural production settings, such as fruit orchards, or tree-covered areas in urban settings, such as city parks, are not considered forest land.
</p>
<p>Timber land is a subset of forest land that is producing or is capable of producing crops of industrial wood and not withdrawn from timber utilization by statute or administrative regulation. (Note: Areas qualifying as timberland are capable of producing at least 20 cubic feet per acre per year of industrial wood in natural stands. Currently inaccessible and inoperable areas are NOT included).
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Dataframe or sf object (if <code>returnSpatial = TRUE</code>). If <code>byPlot = TRUE</code>, values are returned for each plot (proportion of plot in domain of interest; <code>PLOT_STATUS_CD = 1</code> when forest exists at the plot location). All variables with names ending in <code>SE</code>, represent the estimate of sampling error (%) of the variable. When <code>variance = TRUE</code>, variables ending in <code>VAR</code> denote the variance of the variable and <code>N</code> is the total sample size (i.e., including non-zero plots).
</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>YEAR</strong>: reporting year associated with estimates
</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>SYMBOL</strong>: unique species ID from NRCS Plant Reference Guide
</p>

</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>nPlots_AREA</strong>: number of non-zero plots used to compute land area estimates

</li></ul>



<h3>Note</h3>

<p>All sampling error estimates (SE) are returned as the &quot;percent coefficient of variation&quot; (standard deviation / mean * 100) for consistency with EVALIDator. IMPORTANT: sampling error cannot be used to construct confidence intervals. Please use <code>variance = TRUE</code> for that (i.e., return variance and sample size instead of sampling error).</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>To produce spatial plots, summaries must be returned as spatial objects (e.g. specify <code>returnSpatial = TRUE</code> when computing summaries using <code><a href="#topic+tpa">tpa</a></code>). For animated plots, also requires that multiple reporting years be present in the summary data (animations iterate through time). For a map of plot locations contained in your <code>FIA.Database</code>, specify the object as the <code>data</code> argument.
</p>
<p>For objects produced with <code>byPlot = TRUE</code> and <code>returnSpatial = TRUE</code> (spatial point patterns), a categorical grouping variable can be specified to <code>grp</code>. Point radii will reflect magnitude of <code>y</code> and color will reflect categorical groups (<code>grp</code>).
</p>
<p>If <code>animate = FALSE</code> and multiple reporting years are present in the summary, produces plots of the most recent subset.
</p>
<p>Specify <code>savePath</code> and <code>fileName</code> to save plots (animations saved as .gif files).

<p>If <code>common = TRUE</code>, the following tables will be imported: COND, COND_DWM_CALC, INVASIVE_SUBPLOT_SPP, PLOT, POP_ESTN_UNIT, POP_EVAL, POP_EVAL_GRP, POP_EVAL_TYP, POP_PLOT_STRATUM_ASSGN, POP_STRATUM, SUBPLOT, TREE, TREE_GRM_COMPONENT, TREE_GRM_MIDPT, TREE_GRM_BEGIN, SUBP_COND_CHNG_MTRX, SEEDLING, SURVEY, SUBP_COND, P2VEG_SUBP_STRUCTURE. These tables currently support all functionality with <code>rFIA</code>, and it is recommended that only these tables be imported to conserve RAM and reduce processing time.
</p>
<p>If you wish to merge multiple state downloads of FIA data (e.g. North Carolina and Virginia state downloads), simply place both sets of datatables in the same directory (done for you when using <code>getFIA()</code>) and import with <code>readFIA</code>. Upon import, corresponding tables (e.g. NC_PLOT and VA_PLOT) will be merged, and analysis can be completed for the entire region or within spatial units which transcend state boundaries (e.g. Ecoregion subsections).
</p>
<p>Easy, efficient parallelization is implemented with the <code><a href="parallel.html#topic+parallel">parallel</a></code> package. Users must only specify the <code>nCores</code> argument with a value greater than 1 in order to implement parallel processing on their machines. Parallel implementation is achieved using a snow type cluster on any Windows OS, and with multicore forking on any Unix OS (Linux, Mac). Implementing parallel processing may substantially decrease decrease free memory during processing, particularly on Windows OS. Thus, users should be cautious when running in parallel, and consider implementing serial processing for this task if computational resources are limited (<code>nCores = 1</code>).
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>List object containing FIA tables. List elements represent individual FIA tables stored as <code>data.frame</code> objects. Names of list elements reflect names of files from which they were read into R environment (File names should not be changed after download from FIA Datamart).
</p>
<p>If multiple subsets of the FIA database are held in the same directory (e.g. North Carolina and Virginia state downloads), corresponding tables will be merged (e.g. PLOT table returned contains plots in both North Carolina and Virginia).
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>To download subsets of the FIA Database manually, go online to the FIA Datamart (<a href="https://apps.fs.usda.gov/fia/datamart/datamart.html">https://apps.fs.usda.gov/fia/datamart/datamart.html</a>) and choose to download .csv files. Here you can choose to download subsets of the full database for individual states, or select to download individual tables. For use with the <code>rFIA</code> package, we recommend downloading of subsets of the full database representing individual states of interest. Files must be unzipped in order to be imported.
</p>
<p>Alternatively, use <code>getFIA()</code> to automate the download, reading, and saving process for you (recommended).

<h3>Details</h3>

<p><strong>Estimation Details</strong>
</p>
<p>Estimation of forest variables follows the procedures documented in Bechtold and Patterson (2005) and <a href="https://research.fs.usda.gov/treesearch/59521">Stanke et al 2020</a>.
</p>
<p>Specifically, TPA is computed using a sample-based ratio-of-means estimator of total seedlings / total land area within the domain of interest. Percentages of live TPA in the domain of interest are represented as the total number of trees of a particular type (e.g., white pine) / total number of trees (live, all species) within the region. The total populations used to compute these percentages will vary if the user specifies an areaDomain or treeDomain.
</p>
<p>Users may specify alternatives to the 'Temporally Indifferent' estimator using the <code>method</code> argument. Alternative design-based estimators include the annual estimator (&quot;ANNUAL&quot;; annual panels, or estimates from plots measured in the same year), simple moving average (&quot;SMA&quot;; combines annual panels with equal weight), linear moving average (&quot;LMA&quot;; combine annual panels with weights that decay <em>linearly</em> with time since measurement), and exponential moving average (&quot;EMA&quot;; combine annual panels with weights that decay <em>exponentially</em> with time since measurement). The &quot;best&quot; estimator depends entirely on user-objectives, see <a href="https://research.fs.usda.gov/treesearch/59521">Stanke et al 2020</a> for a complete description of these estimators and tradeoffs between precision and temporal specificity.
</p>
<p>When <code>byPlot = FALSE</code> (i.e., population estimates are returned), the &quot;YEAR&quot; column in the resulting dataframe indicates the final year of the inventory cycle that estimates are produced for. For example, an estimate of current forest area (e.g., 2018) may draw on data collected from 2008-2018, and &quot;YEAR&quot; will be listed as 2018 (consistent with EVALIDator). However, when <code>byPlot = TRUE</code> (i.e., plot-level estimates returned), the &quot;YEAR&quot; column denotes the year that each plot was measured (MEASYEAR), which may differ slightly from its associated inventory year (INVYR).
</p>
<p>Stratified random sampling techniques are most often employed to compute estimates in recent inventories, although double sampling and simple random sampling may be employed for early inventories. Estimates are adjusted for non-response bias by assuming attributes of non-response plot locations to be equal to the mean of other plots included within thier respective stratum or population.
</p>
<p><strong>Working with &quot;Big Data&quot;</strong>
</p>
<p>If FIA data are too large to hold in memory (e.g., R throws the &quot;cannot allocate vector of size ...&quot; errors), use larger-than-RAM options. See documentation of <code>link{readFIA}</code> for examples of how to set up a <code>Remote.FIA.Database</code>. As a reference, we have used rFIA's larger-than-RAM methods to estimate forest variables using the entire FIA Database (~50GB) on a standard desktop computer with 16GB of RAM. Check out <a href="https://doserlab.com/files/rfia/">our website</a> for more details and examples.
</p>
<p>Easy, efficient parallelization is implemented with the <code><a href="parallel.html#topic+parallel">parallel</a></code> package. Users must only specify the <code>nCores</code> argument with a value greater than 1 in order to implement parallel processing on their machines. Parallel implementation is achieved using a snow type cluster on any Windows OS, and with multicore forking on any Unix OS (Linux, Mac). Implementing parallel processing may substantially decrease free memory during processing, particularly on Windows OS. Thus, users should be cautious when running in parallel, and consider implementing serial processing for this task if computational resources are limited (<code>nCores = 1</code>).
</p>
<p><strong>Definition of forestland</strong>
</p>
<p>Forest land must have at least 10-percent canopy cover by live tally trees of any size, including land that formerly had such tree cover and that will be naturally or artificially regenerated. Forest land includes transition zones, such as areas between heavily forest and non-forested lands that meet the mimium tree canopy cover and forest areas adjacent to urban and built-up lands. The minimum area for classification of forest land is 1 acre in size and 120 feet wide measured stem-to-stem from the outer-most edge. Roadside, streamside, and shelterbelt strips of trees must have a width of at least 120 feet and continuous length of at least 363 feet to qualify as forest land. Tree-covered areas in agricultural production settings, such as fruit orchards, or tree-covered areas in urban settings, such as city parks, are not considered forest land.
</p>
<p>Timber land is a subset of forest land that is producing or is capable of producing crops of industrial wood and not withdrawn from timber utilization by statute or administrative regulation. (Note: Areas qualifying as timberland are capable of producing at least 20 cubic feet per acre per year of industrial wood in natural stands. Currently inaccessible and inoperable areas are NOT included).
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Dataframe or sf object (if <code>returnSpatial = TRUE</code>). If <code>byPlot = TRUE</code>, values are returned for each plot (<code>PLOT_STATUS_CD = 1</code> when forest exists at the plot location). All variables with names ending in <code>SE</code>, represent the estimate of sampling error (%) of the variable. When <code>variance = TRUE</code>, variables ending in <code>VAR</code> denote the variance of the variable and <code>N</code> is the total sample size (i.e., including non-zero plots).
</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>YEAR</strong>: reporting year associated with estimates
</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>TPA</strong>: estimate of mean trees per acre
</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>TPA_PERC</strong>: estimate of mean proportion of live trees falling within the domain of interest, with respect to trees per acre
</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>nPlots_SEEDLING</strong>: number of non-zero plots used to compute tpa estimates
</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>nPlots_AREA</strong>: number of non-zero plots used to compute land area estimates
</p>
</li></ul>



<h3>Note</h3>

<p>All sampling error estimates (SE) are returned as the &quot;percent coefficient of variation&quot; (standard deviation / mean * 100) for consistency with EVALIDator. IMPORTANT: sampling error cannot be used to construct confidence intervals. Please use <code>variance = TRUE</code> for that (i.e., return variance and sample size instead of sampling error).</p>

<p>Estimation of forest variables follows the procedures documented in Bechtold and Patterson (2005) and <a href="https://research.fs.usda.gov/treesearch/59521">Stanke et al 2020</a>.
</p>
<p>Specifically, the percent land area occupied by forest in each stand structural stage are computed using a sample-based ratio-of-means estimator of total area in structural stage / total land area within the domain of interest. Stand structural stage is classified based on the relative basal area of canopy stems in various size classes (defined below). Only stems which are identified on-site as dominant, subdominant, or intermdediate crown-classes are used to classify stand structural stage.
</p>
<p><strong>Diameter Classes</strong>
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><em>Pole</em>: 12.7 - 25.9 cm
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><em>Mature</em>: 26 - 45.9 cm
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><em>Large</em>: 46+ cm
</p>
</li></ul>

<p><strong>Structural Stage Classification</strong>
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><em>Pole Stage</em>: &gt; 67% BA in pole and mature classes, with more BA in pole than mature.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><em>Mature Stage</em>: &gt; 67% BA in pole and mature classes, with more BA in mature than pole OR &gt; 67% BA in mature and large classes, with more BA in mature.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><em>Late-Successional Stage</em>: &gt; 67% BA in mature and large classes, with more in large
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><em>Mosiac</em>: Any plot not meeting above criteria.
</p>
</li></ul>

<p>Users may specify alternatives to the 'Temporally Indifferent' estimator using the <code>method</code> argument. Alternative design-based estimators include the annual estimator (&quot;ANNUAL&quot;; annual panels, or estimates from plots measured in the same year), simple moving average (&quot;SMA&quot;; combines annual panels with equal weight), linear moving average (&quot;LMA&quot;; combine annual panels with weights that decay <em>linearly</em> with time since measurement), and exponential moving average (&quot;EMA&quot;; combine annual panels with weights that decay <em>exponentially</em> with time since measurement). The &quot;best&quot; estimator depends entirely on user-objectives, see <a href="https://research.fs.usda.gov/treesearch/59521">Stanke et al 2020</a> for a complete description of these estimators and tradeoffs between precision and temporal specificity.
</p>
<p>When <code>byPlot = FALSE</code> (i.e., population estimates are returned), the &quot;YEAR&quot; column in the resulting dataframe indicates the final year of the inventory cycle that estimates are produced for. For example, an estimate of current forest area (e.g., 2018) may draw on data collected from 2008-2018, and &quot;YEAR&quot; will be listed as 2018 (consistent with EVALIDator). However, when <code>byPlot = TRUE</code> (i.e., plot-level estimates returned), the &quot;YEAR&quot; column denotes the year that each plot was measured (MEASYEAR), which may differ slightly from its associated inventory year (INVYR).
</p>
<p>Stratified random sampling techniques are most often employed to compute estimates in recent inventories, although double sampling and simple random sampling may be employed for early inventories. Estimates are adjusted for non-response bias by assuming attributes of non-response plot locations to be equal to the mean of other plots included within thier respective stratum or population.
</p>
<p><strong>Working with &quot;Big Data&quot;</strong>
</p>
<p>If FIA data are too large to hold in memory (e.g., R throws the &quot;cannot allocate vector of size ...&quot; errors), use larger-than-RAM options. See documentation of <code>link{readFIA}</code> for examples of how to set up a <code>Remote.FIA.Database</code>. As a reference, we have used rFIA's larger-than-RAM methods to estimate forest variables using the entire FIA Database (~50GB) on a standard desktop computer with 16GB of RAM. Check out <a href="https://doserlab.com/files/rfia/">our website</a> for more details and examples.
</p>
<p>Easy, efficient parallelization is implemented with the <code><a href="parallel.html#topic+parallel">parallel</a></code> package. Users must only specify the <code>nCores</code> argument with a value greater than 1 in order to implement parallel processing on their machines. Parallel implementation is achieved using a snow type cluster on any Windows OS, and with multicore forking on any Unix OS (Linux, Mac). Implementing parallel processing may substantially decrease free memory during processing, particularly on Windows OS. Thus, users should be cautious when running in parallel, and consider implementing serial processing for this task if computational resources are limited (<code>nCores = 1</code>).
</p>
<p><strong>Definition of forestland</strong>
</p>
<p>Forest land must have at least 10-percent canopy cover by live tally trees of any size, including land that formerly had such tree cover and that will be naturally or artificially regenerated. Forest land includes transition zones, such as areas between heavily forest and non-forested lands that meet the mimium tree canopy cover and forest areas adjacent to urban and built-up lands. The minimum area for classification of forest land is 1 acre in size and 120 feet wide measured stem-to-stem from the outer-most edge. Roadside, streamside, and shelterbelt strips of trees must have a width of at least 120 feet and continuous length of at least 363 feet to qualify as forest land. Tree-covered areas in agricultural production settings, such as fruit orchards, or tree-covered areas in urban settings, such as city parks, are not considered forest land.
</p>
<p>Timber land is a subset of forest land that is producing or is capable of producing crops of industrial wood and not withdrawn from timber utilization by statute or administrative regulation. (Note: Areas qualifying as timberland are capable of producing at least 20 cubic feet per acre per year of industrial wood in natural stands. Currently inaccessible and inoperable areas are NOT included).
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Dataframe or sf object (if <code>returnSpatial = TRUE</code>). If <code>byPlot = TRUE</code>, values are returned for each plot (structural stage of dominant stand type; <code>PLOT_STATUS_CD = 1</code> when forest exists at the plot location). All variables with names ending in <code>SE</code>, represent the estimate of sampling error (%) of the variable. When <code>variance = TRUE</code>, variables ending in <code>VAR</code> denote the variance of the variable and <code>N</code> is the total sample size (i.e., including non-zero plots).
</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>STAGE</strong>: Stand structural stage.
</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>PERC</strong>: % land area in each structural stage.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h3>Note</h3>

<p>All sampling error estimates (SE) are returned as the &quot;percent coefficient of variation&quot; (standard deviation / mean * 100) for consistency with EVALIDator. IMPORTANT: sampling error cannot be used to construct confidence intervals. Please use <code>variance = TRUE</code> for that (i.e., return variance and sample size instead of sampling error).</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Produces tree per acre (TPA) and basal area per acre (BAA) estimates from FIA data, along with population totals for each variable. Estimates can be produced for regions defined within the FIA Database (e.g. counties), at the plot level, or within user-defined areal units. Options to group estimates by species, size class, and other variables defined in the FIADB. If multiple reporting years (EVALIDs) are included in the data, estimates will be output as a time series. If multiple states are represented by the data, estimates will be output for the full region (all area combined), unless specified otherwise (e.g. <code>grpBy = STATECD</code>).

<h3>Details</h3>

<p><strong>Estimation Details</strong>
</p>
<p>Estimation of forest variables follows the procedures documented in Bechtold and Patterson (2005) and <a href="https://research.fs.usda.gov/treesearch/59521">Stanke et al 2020</a>.
</p>
<p>Specifically, TPA and BAA are computed using a sample-based ratio-of-means estimator of total trees (BA) / total land area within the domain of interest. Percentages of TPA and BAA in the domain of interest are represented as the total number of trees of a particular type (live, white pine) / total number of trees (live and dead, all species) within the region. The total populations used to compute these percentages will not change by changing treeType, but will vary if the user specifies an areaDomain or treeDomain.
</p>
<p>Users may specify alternatives to the 'Temporally Indifferent' estimator using the <code>method</code> argument. Alternative design-based estimators include the annual estimator (&quot;ANNUAL&quot;; annual panels, or estimates from plots measured in the same year), simple moving average (&quot;SMA&quot;; combines annual panels with equal weight), linear moving average (&quot;LMA&quot;; combine annual panels with weights that decay <em>linearly</em> with time since measurement), and exponential moving average (&quot;EMA&quot;; combine annual panels with weights that decay <em>exponentially</em> with time since measurement). The &quot;best&quot; estimator depends entirely on user-objectives, see <a href="https://research.fs.usda.gov/treesearch/59521">Stanke et al 2020</a> for a complete description of these estimators and tradeoffs between precision and temporal specificity.
</p>
<p>When <code>byPlot = FALSE</code> (i.e., population estimates are returned), the &quot;YEAR&quot; column in the resulting dataframe indicates the final year of the inventory cycle that estimates are produced for. For example, an estimate of current forest area (e.g., 2018) may draw on data collected from 2008-2018, and &quot;YEAR&quot; will be listed as 2018 (consistent with EVALIDator). However, when <code>byPlot = TRUE</code> (i.e., plot-level estimates returned), the &quot;YEAR&quot; column denotes the year that each plot was measured (MEASYEAR), which may differ slightly from its associated inventory year (INVYR).
</p>
<p>Stratified random sampling techniques are most often employed to compute estimates in recent inventories, although double sampling and simple random sampling may be employed for early inventories. Estimates are adjusted for non-response bias by assuming attributes of non-response plot locations to be equal to the mean of other plots included within thier respective stratum or population.
</p>
<p><strong>Working with &quot;Big Data&quot;</strong>
</p>
<p>If FIA data are too large to hold in memory (e.g., R throws the &quot;cannot allocate vector of size ...&quot; errors), use larger-than-RAM options. See documentation of <code>link{readFIA}</code> for examples of how to set up a <code>Remote.FIA.Database</code>. As a reference, we have used rFIA's larger-than-RAM methods to estimate forest variables using the entire FIA Database (~50GB) on a standard desktop computer with 16GB of RAM. Check out <a href="https://doserlab.com/files/rfia/">our website</a> for more details and examples.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p><strong>Estimation Details</strong>
</p>
<p>Estimation of forest variables follows the procedures documented in Bechtold and Patterson (2005) and <a href="https://research.fs.usda.gov/treesearch/59521">Stanke et al 2020</a>. 
</p>
<p>Specifically, percent areal coverage is computed using a sample-based ratio-of-means estimator of total coverage area / total land area within the domain of interest. Percent coverage estimates are returned separately by canopy layer and growth habit (the general appearance of the plant, including size, shape, growth form, and orientation). Canopy layers 
</p>
<p><strong>Canopy layers</strong>
</p>

<ul>
<li><p> 0 - 2.0 feet 
</p>
</li>
<li><p> 2.1 - 6.0 feet 
</p>
</li>
<li><p> 6.1 - 16.0 feet
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Greater than 16 feet
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Aerial: Canopy cover for all layers
</p>
</li></ul>

<p><strong>Growth habit</strong>
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><em>Forbs</em>: herbaceous, broad-leaved plants; includes non-woody-vines and ferns (does not include mosses and cryptobiotic crusts). 
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><em>Graminoids</em>: grasses and grass-like plants (includes rushes and sedges).
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><em>Non-tally tree</em>: tree species not on a particular FIA work unit's tree tally list that are woody plants with a single well-defined, dominant main stem, not supported by other vegetation or structures (not vines), and which are, or expected to become, greater than 13 feet in height. Seedlings, saplings, and mature plants are included. 
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><em>Shrubs/vines</em>: woody, multiple-stemmed plants of any size, subshrubs (low-growing shrubs under 1.5 feet tall at maturity), and woody vines. Most cacti are included in this category. 
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><em>Tally tree</em>: all core tree species and any core optional tree species selected by a particular FIA work unit. Only tree species on the FIA Master Tree Species List (or those listed as hybrid, variety, or subspecies) are included. Any plant of that species is included, regardless of its shape and regardless of whether it was tallied on the subplot or microplot during the tree tally. Seedlings, saplings, and mature plants are included. 
</p>
</li></ul>

<p>Users may specify alternatives to the 'Temporally Indifferent' estimator using the <code>method</code> argument. Alternative design-based estimators include the annual estimator (&quot;ANNUAL&quot;; annual panels, or estimates from plots measured in the same year), simple moving average (&quot;SMA&quot;; combines annual panels with equal weight), linear moving average (&quot;LMA&quot;; combine annual panels with weights that decay <em>linearly</em> with time since measurement), and exponential moving average (&quot;EMA&quot;; combine annual panels with weights that decay <em>exponentially</em> with time since measurement). The &quot;best&quot; estimator depends entirely on user-objectives, see <a href="https://research.fs.usda.gov/treesearch/59521">Stanke et al 2020</a> for a complete description of these estimators and tradeoffs between precision and temporal specificity.
</p>
<p>When <code>byPlot = FALSE</code> (i.e., population estimates are returned), the &quot;YEAR&quot; column in the resulting dataframe indicates the final year of the inventory cycle that estimates are produced for. For example, an estimate of current forest area (e.g., 2018) may draw on data collected from 2008-2018, and &quot;YEAR&quot; will be listed as 2018 (consistent with EVALIDator). However, when <code>byPlot = TRUE</code> (i.e., plot-level estimates returned), the &quot;YEAR&quot; column denotes the year that each plot was measured (MEASYEAR), which may differ slightly from its associated inventory year (INVYR).
</p>
<p>Stratified random sampling techniques are most often employed to compute estimates in recent inventories, although double sampling and simple random sampling may be employed for early inventories. Estimates are adjusted for non-response bias by assuming attributes of non-response plot locations to be equal to the mean of other plots included within thier respective stratum or population.
</p>
<p><strong>Working with &quot;Big Data&quot;</strong>
</p>
<p>If FIA data are too large to hold in memory (e.g., R throws the &quot;cannot allocate vector of size ...&quot; errors), use larger-than-RAM options. See documentation of <code>link{readFIA}</code> for examples of how to set up a <code>Remote.FIA.Database</code>. As a reference, we have used rFIA's larger-than-RAM methods to estimate forest variables using the entire FIA Database (~50GB) on a standard desktop computer with 16GB of RAM. Check out <a href="https://doserlab.com/files/rfia/">our website</a> for more details and examples.
</p>
<p>Easy, efficient parallelization is implemented with the <code><a href="parallel.html#topic+parallel">parallel</a></code> package. Users must only specify the <code>nCores</code> argument with a value greater than 1 in order to implement parallel processing on their machines. Parallel implementation is achieved using a snow type cluster on any Windows OS, and with multicore forking on any Unix OS (Linux, Mac). Implementing parallel processing may substantially decrease free memory during processing, particularly on Windows OS. Thus, users should be cautious when running in parallel, and consider implementing serial processing for this task if computational resources are limited (<code>nCores = 1</code>).
</p>
<p>Forest land must have at least 10-percent canopy cover by live tally trees of any size, including land that formerly had such tree cover and that will be naturally or artificially regenerated. Forest land includes transition zones, such as areas between heavily forest and non-forested lands that meet the mimium tree canopy cover and forest areas adjacent to urban and built-up lands. The minimum area for classification of forest land is 1 acre in size and 120 feet wide measured stem-to-stem from the outer-most edge. Roadside, streamside, and shelterbelt strips of trees must have a width of at least 120 feet and continuous length of at least 363 feet to qualify as forest land. Tree-covered areas in agricultural production settings, such as fruit orchards, or tree-covered areas in urban settings, such as city parks, are not considered forest land.
</p>
<p>Timber land is a subset of forest land that is producing or is capable of producing crops of industrial wood and not withdrawn from timber utilization by statute or administrative regulation. (Note: Areas qualifying as timberland are capable of producing at least 20 cubic feet per acre per year of industrial wood in natural stands. Currently inaccessible and inoperable areas are NOT included).
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Dataframe or sf object (if <code>returnSpatial = TRUE</code>). If <code>byPlot = TRUE</code>, values are returned for each plot (proportion of plot in domain of interest; <code>PLOT_STATUS_CD = 1</code> when forest exists at the plot location). All variables with names ending in <code>SE</code>, represent the estimate of sampling error (%) of the variable. When <code>variance = TRUE</code>, variables ending in <code>VAR</code> denote the variance of the variable and <code>N</code> is the total sample size (i.e., including non-zero plots).
</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>YEAR</strong>: reporting year associated with estimates
</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>LAYER</strong>: canopy layer
</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>GROWTH_HABIT</strong>: species growth habit
</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>COVER_PCT</strong>: estimate of percent areal coverage of the growth habit within the canopy layer
</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>COVER_AREA_TOTAL</strong>: estimate of areal coverage of the growth habit within the canopy layer (acres) 
</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>AREA_TOTAL</strong>: estimate of total land area (acres) 
</p>
</li>

</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>nPlots_AREA</strong>: number of non-zero plots used to compute land area estimates
</p>
</li></ul>



<h3>Note</h3>

<p>All sampling error estimates (SE) are returned as the &quot;percent coefficient of variation&quot; (standard deviation / mean * 100) for consistency with EVALIDator. IMPORTANT: sampling error cannot be used to construct confidence intervals. Please use <code>variance = TRUE</code> for that (i.e., return variance and sample size instead of sampling error).</p>

<p><strong>Estimation Details</strong>
</p>
<p>Estimation of forest variables follows the procedures documented in Bechtold and Patterson (2005) and <a href="https://research.fs.usda.gov/treesearch/59521">Stanke et al 2020</a>.
</p>
<p>Average annual diameter, basal area, height, and net volume growth of a stem is computed using a sample-based ratio of means estimator of total diameter (basal area, height, net volume) growth / total trees, and average annual basal area and net volume growth per acre is computed as total basal area (net volume) growth / total area. All estimates are returned as average annual rates. Only conditions which were forest in time 1 and in time 2 are included in estimates (excluding converted stands). Only stems 5 inches DBH or greater are included in estimates.
</p>
<p>When <code>treeType = 'all'</code> (default), estimates are of <em>net</em> growth rates (including recruitment and mortality), and hence they may attain a negative value. Negative growth estimates most likely indicate a substantial change in an attribute of the tree or area between time 1 and time 2, which caused the attribute to decrease. Implementation of the growth accounting method allows us to more accurately represent shifts in forest attributes (biomass) between classified groups (size classes) over time. Alternatively, when <code>treeType = 'live'</code>, growth rates are calculated using only trees that were alive at both plot visits and give a more realistic representation of individual tree growth.
</p>
<p>Users may specify alternatives to the 'Temporally Indifferent' estimator using the <code>method</code> argument. Alternative design-based estimators include the annual estimator (&quot;ANNUAL&quot;; annual panels, or estimates from plots measured in the same year), simple moving average (&quot;SMA&quot;; combines annual panels with equal weight), linear moving average (&quot;LMA&quot;; combine annual panels with weights that decay <em>linearly</em> with time since measurement), and exponential moving average (&quot;EMA&quot;; combine annual panels with weights that decay <em>exponentially</em> with time since measurement). The &quot;best&quot; estimator depends entirely on user-objectives, see <a href="https://research.fs.usda.gov/treesearch/59521">Stanke et al 2020</a> for a complete description of these estimators and tradeoffs between precision and temporal specificity.

<p>When <code>byPlot = FALSE</code> (i.e., population estimates are returned), the &quot;YEAR&quot; column in the resulting dataframe indicates the final year of the inventory cycle that estimates are produced for. For example, an estimate of current forest area (e.g., 2018) may draw on data collected from 2008-2018, and &quot;YEAR&quot; will be listed as 2018 (consistent with EVALIDator). However, when <code>byPlot = TRUE</code> (i.e., plot-level estimates returned), the &quot;YEAR&quot; column denotes the year that each plot was measured (MEASYEAR), which may differ slightly from its associated inventory year (INVYR).

<h2 id='volume'>Estimate merchantable tree volume from the FIADB</h2><span id='topic+volume'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Produces estimates of merchantable tree volume (i.e., merchantable bole volume and sawlog volume) on a per acre basis from FIA data, along with population estimates for each variable. Estimates can be produced for regions defined within the FIA Database (e.g. counties), at the plot level, or within user-defined areal units. Options to group estimates by species, size class, and other variables defined in the FIADB. If multiple reporting years (EVALIDs) are included in the data, estimates will be output as a time series. If multiple states are represented by the data, estimates will be output for the full region (all area combined), unless specified otherwise (e.g. <code>grpBy = STATECD</code>).</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p><strong>Estimation Details</strong>
</p>
<p>Estimation of forest variables follows the procedures documented in Bechtold and Patterson (2005) and <a href="https://research.fs.usda.gov/treesearch/59521">Stanke et al 2020</a>. Specifically, tree volume per acre is computed using a sample-based ratio-of-means estimator of total volume / total land area within the domain of interest.
</p>
<p>Estimates of total merchantable volume are in units of cubic feet (CF), and estimates of sawlog volume in terms of cubic feet and thousand board feet (MBF; International 1/4 inch rule). FIA's net volume definition is used by default (<code>volType = "NET"</code>): &quot;net volume of wood in the central stem of a sample tree 5.0 inches d.b.h., from a 1-foot stump to a minimum 4-inch top diameter, or to where the central stem breaks into limbs all of which are &lt;4.0 inches in diameter... Does not include rotten, missing, and form cull (volume loss due to rotten, missing, and form cull defect has been deducted)&quot;. Users opt to use two alternative definitions: sound volume (<code>volType = "SOUND"</code>) or gross volume (<code>volType = "GROSS"</code>). Sound volume is identical to net volume except that sound includes volume from portions of the stem that can be considered &quot;form cull&quot; under the net volume definition (e.g., sweep). In contrast, gross volume is identical to the net volume definition except that gross includes volume from portions of the stem that are rotten, missing, and considered form cull.
</p>
<p>Users may specify alternatives to the 'Temporally Indifferent' estimator using the <code>method</code> argument. Alternative design-based estimators include the annual estimator (&quot;ANNUAL&quot;; annual panels, or estimates from plots measured in the same year), simple moving average (&quot;SMA&quot;; combines annual panels with equal weight), linear moving average (&quot;LMA&quot;; combine annual panels with weights that decay <em>linearly</em> with time since measurement), and exponential moving average (&quot;EMA&quot;; combine annual panels with weights that decay <em>exponentially</em> with time since measurement). The &quot;best&quot; estimator depends entirely on user-objectives, see <a href="https://research.fs.usda.gov/treesearch/59521">Stanke et al 2020</a> for a complete description of these estimators and tradeoffs between precision and temporal specificity.
</p>
<p>When <code>byPlot = FALSE</code> (i.e., population estimates are returned), the &quot;YEAR&quot; column in the resulting dataframe indicates the final year of the inventory cycle that estimates are produced for. For example, an estimate of current forest area (e.g., 2018) may draw on data collected from 2008-2018, and &quot;YEAR&quot; will be listed as 2018 (consistent with EVALIDator). However, when <code>byPlot = TRUE</code> (i.e., plot-level estimates returned), the &quot;YEAR&quot; column denotes the year that each plot was measured (MEASYEAR), which may differ slightly from its associated inventory year (INVYR).
</p>
<p>Stratified random sampling techniques are most often employed to compute estimates in recent inventories, although double sampling and simple random sampling may be employed for early inventories. Estimates are adjusted for non-response bias by assuming attributes of non-response plot locations to be equal to the mean of other plots included within thier respective stratum or population.
</p>
<p><strong>Working with &quot;Big Data&quot;</strong>
</p>
<p>If FIA data are too large to hold in memory (e.g., R throws the &quot;cannot allocate vector of size ...&quot; errors), use larger-than-RAM options. See documentation of <code>link{readFIA}</code> for examples of how to set up a <code>Remote.FIA.Database</code>. As a reference, we have used rFIA's larger-than-RAM methods to estimate forest variables using the entire FIA Database (~50GB) on a standard desktop computer with 16GB of RAM. Check out <a href="https://doserlab.com/files/rfia/">our website</a> for more details and examples.
</p>
<p>Easy, efficient parallelization is implemented with the <code><a href="parallel.html#topic+parallel">parallel</a></code> package. Users must only specify the <code>nCores</code> argument with a value greater than 1 in order to implement parallel processing on their machines. Parallel implementation is achieved using a snow type cluster on any Windows OS, and with multicore forking on any Unix OS (Linux, Mac). Implementing parallel processing may substantially decrease free memory during processing, particularly on Windows OS. Thus, users should be cautious when running in parallel, and consider implementing serial processing for this task if computational resources are limited (<code>nCores = 1</code>).
</p>
<p><strong>Definition of forestland</strong>
</p>
<p>Forest land must have at least 10-percent canopy cover by live tally trees of any size, including land that formerly had such tree cover and that will be naturally or artificially regenerated. Forest land includes transition zones, such as areas between heavily forest and non-forested lands that meet the mimium tree canopy cover and forest areas adjacent to urban and built-up lands. The minimum area for classification of forest land is 1 acre in size and 120 feet wide measured stem-to-stem from the outer-most edge. Roadside, streamside, and shelterbelt strips of trees must have a width of at least 120 feet and continuous length of at least 363 feet to qualify as forest land. Tree-covered areas in agricultural production settings, such as fruit orchards, or tree-covered areas in urban settings, such as city parks, are not considered forest land.
</p>
<p>Timber land is a subset of forest land that is producing or is capable of producing crops of industrial wood and not withdrawn from timber utilization by statute or administrative regulation. (Note: Areas qualifying as timberland are capable of producing at least 20 cubic feet per acre per year of industrial wood in natural stands. Currently inaccessible and inoperable areas are NOT included).
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Dataframe or sf object (if <code>returnSpatial = TRUE</code>). If <code>byPlot = TRUE</code>, values are returned for each plot (<code>PLOT_STATUS_CD = 1</code> when forest exists at the plot location). All variables with names ending in <code>SE</code>, represent the estimate of sampling error (%) of the variable. When <code>variance = TRUE</code>, variables ending in <code>VAR</code> denote the variance of the variable and <code>N</code> is the total sample size (i.e., including non-zero plots).
</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>YEAR</strong>: reporting year associated with estimates
</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>BOLE_CF_ACRE</strong>: estimate of mean merchantable bole volume per acre (cu.ft./acre)
</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>SAW_CF_ACRE</strong>: estimate of mean merchantable sawtimber volume per acre (cu.ft./acre)
</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>SAW_MBF_ACRE</strong>: estimate of mean merchantable sawtimber volume per acre (thousand board feet/acre; International 1/4 inch rule)
</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>nPlots_TREE</strong>: number of non-zero plots used to compute volume estimates
</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>nPlots_AREA</strong>: number of non-zero plots used to compute land area estimates
</p>
</li></ul>



<h3>Note</h3>

<p>All sampling error estimates (SE) are returned as the &quot;percent coefficient of variation&quot; (standard deviation / mean * 100) for consistency with EVALIDator. IMPORTANT: sampling error cannot be used to construct confidence intervals. Please use <code>variance = TRUE</code> for that (i.e., return variance and sample size instead of sampling error).</p>
