<h2 id='cxi_calc'>Tidy Calculation of Customer Experience Index</h2><span id='topic+cxi_calc'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Simplifies the calculation of Customer Experience Index (CXi) from raw survey data within
the tidyverse framework.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>cxi_calc(survey_data, ..., cx_high = 4, cx_low = 2)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table role = "presentation">
<tr><td><code id="cxi_calc_+3A_survey_data">survey_data</code></td>
<td>
<p>Raw survey data. Needs to be one row per survey with the three CXi question
responses having column names of needs, ease and emotion</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="cxi_calc_+3A_...">...</code></td>
<td>
<p>optional columns by which to group the CXi calculation. There is no limit to
the number of grouping variables chosen. Too many will likely result in CXi calculations
that are too fragmented / based on very small survey counts.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="cxi_calc_+3A_cx_high">cx_high</code></td>
<td>
<p>Threshold in scale where response at or above is a &quot;high&quot;</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="cxi_calc_+3A_cx_low">cx_low</code></td>
<td>
<p>Threshold in scale where response at or below is a &quot;low&quot;</p>
</td></tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Customer Experience Index is a metric created by Forrester to help companies systematically
measure customer experience in a way that their research has found is connected to
improving customer loyalty. More information can be found at https://go.forrester.com/analytics/cx-index/
</p>
<p>The calculation across an entire sample of surveys is simple. A customer experience
manager may want to calculate CXi across many different dimensions and filtering
in different ways; the functions in this package utilize the tidy framework to streamline
calculating CXi along as many dimensions as desired.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Data frame with CXi and survey count for each combination of the grouping variables
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>needs &lt;- sample(5, 100, replace = TRUE)
ease &lt;- sample(5, 100, replace = TRUE)
emotion &lt;- sample(5, 100, replace = TRUE)
cx_date &lt;- rep(seq.Date(from = as.Date("2019-01-01"), to = as.Date("2019-01-10"), by = "day"), 10)
cx_group &lt;- rep(c("a", "b", "c", "d"), 25)
df &lt;- data.frame(needs, ease, emotion, cx_date, cx_group)
cxi_calc(df, cx_group)
</code></pre>

<h2 id='cxi_trend'>Tidy Calculation of Customer Experience Index trends by group</h2><span id='topic+cxi_trend'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Simplifies the calculation of Customer Experience Index (CXi) trends over time from raw survey
data within the tidyverse framework.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>cxi_trend(
  survey_data,
  trend_var,
  ...,
  cx_high = 4,
  cx_low = 2,
  min_surveys = 1,

</p>
<p>The trend version of the function allows you to specify one column as a date over which to
trend the data. This allows quick filtering to eliminate groupings that fail to meet
user-specified thresholds for average or minimum survey counts per time period.
</p>
<p>The resulting data set is set up for creating faceted line plots using ggplot2.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Data frame with CXi and survey count for each combination of the grouping variables over
the time variable.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>needs &lt;- sample(5, 100, replace = TRUE)
ease &lt;- sample(5, 100, replace = TRUE)

<h2 id='nps_calc'>Tidy Calculation of Net Promoter Score</h2><span id='topic+nps_calc'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Simplifies the calculation of Net Promoter Score (NPS) from raw survey data within
the tidyverse framework.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>nps_calc(survey_data, ...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table role = "presentation">
<tr><td><code id="nps_calc_+3A_survey_data">survey_data</code></td>
<td>
<p>Raw survey data. Needs to be one row per survey with the nps question
in a numeric column called nps_question</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="nps_calc_+3A_...">...</code></td>
<td>
<p>Optional columns by which to group the nps calculation. There is no limit to
the number of grouping variables chosen. Too many will likely result in nps calculations
that are too fragmented / based on very small survey counts.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Net Promoter Score was originally developed by Fred Reichheld and now is owned by
Bain Company and Satmetrix Systems. According to Wikipedia it &quot;is a management
tool that can be used to gauge the loyalty of a firm's customer relationships.&quot;
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>
