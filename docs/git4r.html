<h2 id='git'>Auto Git</h2><span id='topic+git'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Call the git pull-add-commit-push cycle interactively. This is the default
helper function to call continuously to log changes and stay up-to-date.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>git()
</code></pre>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Invisible NULL
</p>


<h3>See Also</h3>

<p>git_remote, git_add, git_commit, git_push, git_branch, git_diff
</p>

<hr>
<h2 id='git_add'>Git Add</h2><span id='topic+git_add'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Prints all changed files since last commit and waits for you to hit
ENTER to add everything, or type out the space-separated numbers of
what you do want to add to the next commit, else ESCAPE to cancel.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>git_add()
</code></pre>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Files can are selected by number by typing a list of space-separated
values. The inverse can also be used, for example &quot;-2 -4&quot; would add all
<em>except</em> the 2nd and 4th file.
</p>
<p>Each file or directory is given a symbol for change type:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>-</code> has been deleted
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>+</code> has been created
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>*</code> has been changed since <code>git_add()</code> was last called and should be re-added
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>@</code> has been renamed, but this will often show as a pair of <code>+</code> and <code>-</code>
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code style="white-space: pre;">&#8288;?&#8288;</code> contains conflict from latest merge; go in and edit by hand, searching
for &quot;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD&quot; up to &quot;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (some branch)&quot;
</p>
</li></ul>

<p>For any file which has been flagged by <code>git_pull()</code> or <code>git_merge()</code> as containing
conflicts, these are <em>not</em> included by hitting ENTER and must be added by number.
This is to reduce the risk of accidentally committing a whole load of conflicts.
Each file should be inspected manually before adding.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Invisible NULL
</p>

<hr>
<h2 id='git_branch'>Git Branch</h2><span id='topic+git_branch'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Swaps to a different branch if exists, otherwise makes one from most recent
commit, and checks out this branch. If no branch name is specified, all
branches will be printed.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>git_branch(branchname = NULL)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table role = "presentation">
<tr><td><code id="git_branch_+3A_branchname">branchname</code></td>
<td>
<p>Branch name to move to or create, use empty string &quot;&quot; to list
existing branches. This is asked interactively if left as NULL.</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Changing to a branch which is only listed under remote (for example origin/test)
by <code>git_branch('test')</code> will automatically create a local copy of this branch.
</p>
<p>If there are uncommitted changes, it will forbid changing to an existing
branch which would result in irreversible loss of current working directory.
If the branch does not exist yet, the working directory is not changed and
the next commit will be on this new branch.
</p>
<p>You are allowed to change branch to any which share the same latest commit
so you can create a branch and instantly remove it, whilst keeping any
uncommitted changes. The user is notified that the branch has been changed
invisibly (namely with no change to the working directory). This may result
in a warning that not all changes have been committed when returning much later
to the first branch if some changes are staged,
</p>
<p>Currently, this is the only situation you are allowed to delete a branch,
because in other situations it would result in irreversibly loss of commits
(although <code>git_undo()</code> will still work for a short time to find orphaned commits).
For now, housekeeping and deleting branches should be done manually with system
git or <code>git2r::branch_delete()</code> if you are really sure.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Invisible NULL
</p>


<h3>See Also</h3>

<p>git_merge
</p>

<hr>
<h2 id='git_checkout'>Git Checkout Commit</h2><span id='topic+git_checkout'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Rewind the entire working directory to a previous commit and start a new branch
from there. Use this if you want to backtrack reversibly. If you want to
wind back irreversibly to a previous commit, use <code>git_undo()</code>.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>git_checkout(commit, onto_new_branch)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table role = "presentation">
<tr><td><code id="git_checkout_+3A_commit">commit</code></td>
<td>
<p>Commit object as returned by git_get() or git_history()</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="git_checkout_+3A_onto_new_branch">onto_new_branch</code></td>
<td>
<p>Name of new branch to start from this historic commit</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>A typical work flow could be to retract three commits on the master branch.
Use <code>git_checkout(commit=git_get(n=3), onto_new_branch='temp')</code>. Then move back
to the master branch with <code>git_branch('master')</code> and merge the old version back
in with <code>git_merge('temp')</code>.
</p>
<p>The alternative (<code>git_undo()</code> and then select 3rd commit) will delete all record
of the three intermediate commits in the long run.
</p>
<p>As with changing branch, it is forbidden to change with changes yet-to-be-committed.
This is to prevent irreversible loss if you ever wanted to change back again.
</p>
<p>There is currently no option to checkout a specific file, however this can be
done by calling <code>git_diff()</code> and finding the named 'git4r_abc123' in
<code>tempdir()</code>
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Invisible NULL
</p>


<h3>See Also</h3>

<p>git_get, git_history, git_diff, git_undo
</p>

<hr>
<h2 id='git_clone'>Git Clone from Default Remote</h2><span id='topic+git_clone'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Clone another repository given as a URL of absolute filepath. Alternatively,
if <code>GIT_DEFAULT_REMOTE</code> environmental variable has been set
a list of repositories within this path is displayed and can be cloned by name.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>git_clone(repo_name = "", to = "~/")
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table role = "presentation">
<tr><td><code id="git_clone_+3A_repo_name">repo_name</code></td>
<td>
<p>Name of repo to clone, leave blank to display a list of available
repo names. Also accepted is the url or complete filepath to a
repo to clone (identified if containing '/').</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="git_clone_+3A_to">to</code></td>
<td>
<p>Local path to create local project folder in, defaults to home directory</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Running <code>repo_name=""</code> will print a list of valid repositories found at the
<code>GIT_DEFAULT_REMOTE</code> path, and can then be re-run with one of these names to
clone a local version. This is to make basic on-premises collaboration and backups
more effortless. <code>GIT_DEFAULT_REMOTE</code> can be set in .Renviron file as per <code>?git_remote</code>
</p>
<p>Other repositories can be cloned as expected by giving a URL. Credentials are handled
automatically in the same way as <code>?git_push</code>.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Invisible NULL
</p>

<hr>
<h2 id='git_commit'>Git Commit</h2><span id='topic+git_commit'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Make a commit checkpoint of the entire working directory except any changes which
have not been added, or files listed in <code>.gitignore</code>. Run <code>git_add()</code> immediately
before to confirm what changes are going to be included / excluded.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>git_commit(message = NULL, confirm_id = TRUE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table role = "presentation">
<tr><td><code id="git_commit_+3A_message">message</code></td>
<td>
<p>Commit message, usually one sentence about a specific change,
character atomic. This is asked for interactively if left NULL.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="git_commit_+3A_confirm_id">confirm_id</code></td>
<td>
<p>Print out the current user identity which will be used for
the commit (this is always done for <code>git_pull()</code> )</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Commit messages are personal preference and many examples of good practice can
be found online. These messages should be useful for:
</p>

<ul>
<li><p> informing yourself and others of what development choices have been made so far
</p>
</li>
<li><p> searching for a particular change, for example like <code>git_history(message='bugfix 123')</code>
</p>
</li>
<li><p> explaining a particular change for somebody else to review and accept
</p>
</li></ul>

<p>The current user identity (username and email) is printed to confirm who will
be tagged as making the commit. If this has not yet been configured, these
details are prompted interactively.
</p>
<p>Amending commits is not currently possible (see issue #213 for git2r) therefore
a commit message cannot be left blank.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Invisible NULL
</p>

<hr>
<h2 id='git_diff'>Git Diff</h2><span id='topic+git_diff'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Display the difference between two commits of a file or a directory structure.
Paths must be relative to the top-level git directory so it is recommended that
<code>getwd()</code> is the same so that tab auto-complete gives the right path. The default
filter is <code>n=1</code> and <code>NULL</code> meaning compare working tree (or a file contents)
of latest commit with current working directory.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>git_diff(path = ".", ...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table role = "presentation">
<tr><td><code id="git_diff_+3A_path">path</code></td>
<td>
<p>Path or directory to compare - must be relative to the
root directory of the repository, regardless of whether <code>getwd()</code>
is a subdirectory.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="git_diff_+3A_...">...</code></td>
<td>
<p>Two arguments to be passed for which versions to select: can be
a commit object from git_history() or get_git(), or a single filter
argument which is passed to get_git().</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Two commits can be specified using <code>git_get()</code> or <code>git_history()[[i]]</code>, or a
single named filter argument for each commit for simple requests. Use <code>NULL</code>
to compare with the current working file (not even committed yet).
</p>
<p>Hidden files (for example '.Rbuildignore') are omitted when listing current
directory contents (a commit identifier of NULL), neither is .gitignore
respected, so all ignored files will be flagged up.
</p>
<p>Usually the more recent commit should be second so that additions are shown
in green.
</p>
<p>Previous versions of files can be opened for editing by finding them at the
<code>tempdir()</code> path.
</p>
<p>See ?git_history for the filter arguments that can be used
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A diffr htmlwidget object which is automatically opened in RStudio Viewer tab
</p>


<h3>See Also</h3>

<p>git_history
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>## Not run: 
# Compare the last committed change with current working version
git_diff() # this is exactly equivalent to next line
git_diff('.', n=1, NULL)
git_diff('README.md')
git_diff('README.md', n=2)
git_diff('README.md', n=2, n=1)

# Compare the directory structure now with a previous date
git_diff('.', before='2021-10-25')

# Latest between branches
git_diff('myfile', branch='master', branch='test')

# Compare file contents of a commit hash with most recent by author
git_diff('R/git_helper.R', hash='abc123', author='somebody')

# Can also get a git_commit object directly to pass over if multiple filtering
git_diff('R/', git_get(author='somebody', before='2021-10-25'), NULL)

# Or even taking a commit number from the branch history (but will be verbose)
git_diff('README.md', git_history()[[1]], n=1 )

## End(Not run)

</code></pre>

<hr>
<h2 id='git_history'>Git Display History and Select Commit</h2><span id='topic+git_history'></span><span id='topic+git_get'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Display the history of commits in a specific branch with the option to filter.
The list of commits is returned invisibly and can be extracted using <code style="white-space: pre;">&#8288;[[i]]&#8288;</code>
alternatively use <code>git_get()</code> to return the newest commit after filtering.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>git_history(path = ".", branch = NULL, top = 10, ...)

git_get(path = ".", branch = NULL, ...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table role = "presentation">

<td>
<p>Only display / search commits which affect this path (dir or file)</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="git_history_+3A_branch">branch</code></td>
<td>
<p>Name of branch to display. If a match cannot be found with
git_get() in this branch, all branches are searched. Remote
branches can be viewed by using the format &quot;origin/master&quot;
providing that fetch or pull has downloaded changes.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="git_history_+3A_top">top</code></td>
<td>
<p>Maximum number of commits to display (post-filtering)</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="git_history_+3A_...">...</code></td>
<td>
<p>Filters such as before='2021-01-01' or author='somebody'</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>By default the history of the current branch is returned. The commits of a remote
branch can be found using <code style="white-space: pre;">&#8288;branch='origin/master&#8288;</code>, for example.
</p>
<p>The following filter arguments can be given:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>n</code> - integer vector of commits back from latest (1 = most recent commit)
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>hash</code> - character to match the beginning of commit hash
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>before</code> and <code>after</code> - date object or string like '2021-01-31'
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>message</code> - regular expression string to find in commit message
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>author</code> and <code>email</code> - regular expression string of author or email of the commit
</p>
</li></ul>

<p>If nothing could be matched, <code>get_git()</code> will start looking on other branches,
for example when looking for a particular hash. The user is notified if this
happens.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Return the git_commit object which best matches a wide variety of types. This
is used for git_diff() and git_checkout().
</p>
<p>Vector of commit objects invisibly
</p>
<p>Single commit object
</p>

<hr>
<h2 id='git_merge'>Merge Branch into Current Branch</h2><span id='topic+git_merge'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Merge a different branch into the current branch. The user is asked interactively
to delete the merged (and now expendable) branch, and any conflicts arising are
printed and the option given to open the files immediately for editing. Any
files which resulted in conflicts will be flagged by <code>git_add()</code> to remind
the user to manually confirm conflicts are resolved.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>git_merge(branchname = NULL)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table role = "presentation">
<tr><td><code id="git_merge_+3A_branchname">branchname</code></td>
<td>
<p>Name of other branch to merge into the current one, will be asked
interactively if left as NULL.</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>A very helpful tool in RStudio is <code>Edit</code> -&gt; <code style="white-space: pre;">&#8288;Find in Files...&#8288;</code> which allows
you to search your entire repository for where the conflicts are. These are
identified by searching for the chevrons &lt;&lt;&lt;
</p>
<p>Conflicts are the usual format for git and may also happen after <code>git_pull()</code>
</p>
<pre>

<h3>Value</h3>

</p>

<hr>
<h2 id='git_pull'>Git Pull</h2><span id='topic+git_pull'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This will pull any updates from the 'origin' remote for every branch.
This should be run before making a commit (as is done by wrapper <code>git()</code>) in
order to avoid conflicts arising if somebody else has made changes
on the same branch. If this happens, merge conflicts are raised in the usual
way and <code>git_add()</code> will show you what needs resolving.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>git_pull()
</code></pre>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>To setup an 'origin' remote, use <code>git_remote()</code>. Credentials are handled
in the same way as <code>git_push()</code>, see <code>?git_push</code> for details.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Invisible NULL
</p>


<h3>See Also</h3>

<p>git_push, git_remote
</p>

<hr>
<h2 id='git_push'>Git Push</h2><span id='topic+git_push'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Pushes just current branch to 'origin' by default, but allows selective
pushing of branches to different remotes if this is declined, for example
if you want to keep a test branch private.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>git_push(do_default = NULL)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table role = "presentation">
<tr><td><code id="git_push_+3A_do_default">do_default</code></td>
<td>
<p>Character or logical passed as the answer to the interactive question
which is &quot;push the current branch to origin&quot;. If 'Y' or TRUE, this function
runs without user input (used by <code>git()</code>), the default value <code>NULL</code> will
prompt the user to answer interactively.</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>It is enforced that when pushing to 'origin' the branch is set to track this
remote branch. If the branch does not exist yet in the remote, it is not
pushed by default and must be manually added.
</p>
<p>Credentials are sorted in the same way for <code>git_pull()</code> and <code>git_push()</code>. If
<code>gitcreds</code> package is installed, this is used first to check whether the
system git installation already has a username / password for this host.
This can be changed or added using stand-alone git, or <code>gitcreds::gitcreds_set()</code>.
</p>
<p>Alternatively, if <code>gitcreds</code> is not installed, a system-git is not available,
or no existing git credentials are found, then the the environmental variables
are searched for a suitable Personal Access Token. The variable name must begin
<code>GIT_PAT</code> and any additional words are used to distinguish the PAT for the relevant
host using a closest-string match for the remote URL, for example
<code>GIT_PAT_AZURE=abc123def456</code> will be chosen to authenticate
an Azure DevOps remote above <code>GIT_PAT_GITHUB</code> or <code>GIT_PAT_GITLAB</code>.
</p>
<p>To set this up from scratch by creating a Personal Access Token and saving it
to your <code>.Renviron</code> file with the name &quot;GIT_PAT****&quot; where asterisks can be
replaced with part of the remote URL if you need to distinguish between several
different PATs (and a good reminder of what it is).

<hr>
<h2 id='git_remote'>Git Modify Remotes</h2><span id='topic+git_remote'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>View and interactively edit remotes for this repo. The most important of these
is 'origin' which will be used by <code>git_pull()</code>, however you may also want a
write-only mirror, for example where you push a production-ready commit. If
<code>GIT_DEFAULT_REMOTE</code> environmental value has been set, this will be suggested
for 'origin'.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>git_remote(remote_name = NULL, remote_path = NULL)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table role = "presentation">
<tr><td><code id="git_remote_+3A_remote_name">remote_name</code></td>
<td>
<p>Name of remote to add (such as 'origin') else leave NULL
and answer interactively</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="git_remote_+3A_remote_path">remote_path</code></td>
<td>
<p>Path / URL of remote to add, empty string will use
<code>GIT_DEFAULT_REMOTE</code> env variable, else leave NULL and
answer interactively</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>If using a filesystem path for the remote, you can only create a bare repository
as the remote as limited by <code>git2r::push()</code>. A bare repository has the advantage
for 'origin' because no one should make any changes to this directly
(instead, clone their own copy).
</p>
<p>If you have set <code>GIT_DEFAULT_REMOTE</code> environmental value this will be suggested
as the path for creating an 'origin' remote. This will make life easier because
it will be the same as the rest of your projects / team and will be searched
by <code>git_clone()</code>. Put this value in your user settings with
<code>file.edit('~/.Renviron')</code> or as a one-off:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>Sys.setenv(GIT_DEFAULT_REMOTE='P:/ath/to/teams/remote_repo/folder')</code>
</p>
</li></ul>

<p>It is possible to use an on-premises 'origin' remote which in turn synchronises
with another server.
This 'hybrid' is best achieved by using fully-fledged git installation set up
to synchronise as a scheduled task or somehow triggered. The shared-drive
remote repo can be overwritten with:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code style="white-space: pre;">&#8288;git clone --mirror &lt;url&gt;&#8288;</code>
</p>
</li></ul>

<p>And then these commands run regularly will keep both in sync. If a branch gets
divergent commits between cloud and shared-drive, the latter will take precedence.
This has not been thoroughly tested and goes beyond the limitations of this
package!
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code style="white-space: pre;">&#8288;git push&#8288;</code>
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code style="white-space: pre;">&#8288;git remote update --prune&#8288;</code>
</p>
</li></ul>

<p>Reset working directory to any previous commit, or action. This will not change
the active branch so do this <em>first</em> if you want to continue on a different
branch. All previous commits are shown, even if the branch they were on has
been deleted, and this undo 'reset' itself will appear as a 'reflog' action.
</p>
