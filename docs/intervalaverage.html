<tr>
<td>Description:</td>
<td>Perform fast and memory efficient time-weighted averaging of values 
    measured over intervals into new arbitrary intervals. 
	This package is useful in the context of data measured or represented
	as constant values over intervals on a one-dimensional discrete axis 
	(e.g. time-integrated averages of a curve over defined periods). 
	This package was written specifically to deal with air 
	pollution data recorded or predicted as averages over sampling periods. 
	Data in this format often needs to be shifted to non-aligned periods 
	or averaged up to periods of longer duration (e.g. averaging data measured over 
	sequential non-overlapping periods to calendar years). </td>

<h2 id='CJ.dt'>grid expand an arbitrary number of data.tables</h2><span id='topic+CJ.dt'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>similar to data.table::CJ and base::expand.grid except for rows of data.tables.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>CJ.dt(..., groups = NULL)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr><td><code id="CJ.dt_+3A_...">...</code></td>
<td>
<p>data.tables</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="CJ.dt_+3A_groups">groups</code></td>
<td>
<p>a character vector corresponding to
column names of grouping vars in all of the data.tables</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>CJ.dt computes successive cartesian join over rows of each table
paying no attention to whatever the tables are keyed on.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>#' CJ.dt(data.table(c(1,2,2),c(1,1,1)),data.table(c("a","b"),c("c","d")))
#If you want to expand x to unique values of a non-unique columns in y

<h2 id='intervalaverage'>time-weighted average of values measured over intervals</h2><span id='topic+intervalaverage'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>intervalaverage</code> takes values recorded over
non-overlapping intervals and averages them to defined intervals, possibly within
groups (individuals/monitors/locations/etc).  This function could be used to take averages over long
intervals
of values measured over short intervals and/or to take short &quot;averages&quot; of values measured over
longer intervals (ie, downsample without smoothing). Measurement intervals and averaging intervals need
not align. In the event that an averaging interval contains more than one measurement interval,
a weighted average is calculated (ie each measurement is weighted on the duration of its interval's
overlap with the averaging period interval).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>intervalaverage(
  x,
  y,
  interval_vars,
  value_vars,
  group_vars = NULL,
  required_percentage = 100,

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>All intervals are treated as closed (ie inclusive of the start and end values in interval_vars)
</p>
<p>x and y are not copied but rather passed by reference to function internals
but the order of these data.tables is restored on function completion or error,
</p>
<p>When required_percentage is less than 100, xminstart and xmaxend may be useful to
determine whether an average meets specified coverage requirements in terms of not
just percent of missingness but whether values are represented through the range of the y interval
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>returns a data.table object.
Rows of the return data.table correspond to intervals from y. i.e, the number
of rows of the return will be the number of rows of y.
Columns of the returned data.table are as follows: <br />
</p>

<ul>
<li><p> grouping variables as specified in <code>group_vars</code> <br />
</p>
</li>
<li><p> interval columns corresponding to intervals in y. These columns are named the
same they were in x and y and as specified in <code>interval_vars</code>
</p>
</li>
<li><p> value variable columns from x, averaged to periods in y.
named the same as they were in x <br />
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>yduration</code>: the length of the interval (ie as a count) specified in y <br />
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>xduration</code>: the total length of the intervals (ie as a count)
from x that fall into this interval from y. this will be equal to
yduration if x is comprehensive for (ie, fully covers)  this interval from y. <br />
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>nobs_&lt;value_vars&gt;</code>: for each <code>value_var</code> specified, this is the count of
non-missing values from x that fall into this interval from y. this will be
equal to xduration if the value_var contains no NA values over the y
interval. If there are NAs in value variables, then <code>nobs_&lt;value_vars&gt;</code>
will be different from <code>xduration</code> and won't necessarily be all the same
for each value_var.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>xminstart</code>: For each returned interval (ie the intervals from Y) the minimum of the
start intervals represented in x.  If the start of the earliest x interval is less than the start
of the y interval, the minimum of the y interval is returned. Note, this is the minimum start
time in x matching with the y interval whether or not any value_vars were missing or not for that start time.
If you need non-missing minimum start times, you could remove NA intervals from
x prior to calling intervalaverage (this would need to be done separately for each value_var).
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>xmaxend</code>:  similar to xminstart but the maximum of the end intervals represented in x.
Again, this does not pay attention to whether the interval in x had non-missing value_vars.
</p>
</li></ul>

<h2 id='intervalintersect'>Intersect intervals within groups</h2><span id='topic+intervalintersect'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Given two tables each containing a set of intervals, find all interval intersections within groups.
Returns a data.table containing all columns from both tables.
One use of this function is to take a table  containing an address history
(a table containing the intervals when study participants lived at past addresses)
and join it to an exposure history table (a complete set of exposure predictions
for each address, where the exposures are stored as the average value over a
set of intervals) returning the set of
exposure intervals at addresses clipped to exactly when the participant lived at that address.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>intervalintersect(
  x,
  y,
  interval_vars,
  group_vars = NULL,
  interval_vars_out = c("start", "end"),
  verbose = FALSE
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<p>A data.table with two columns defining closed intervals (see also interval_vars parameter)</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="intervalintersect_+3A_y">y</code></td>
<td>
<p>A data.table with two columns defining closed intervals (see also interval_vars parameter)</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="intervalintersect_+3A_interval_vars">interval_vars</code></td>
<td>
<p>Either a length-2 character vector denoting column names in both x and y or a named
length-2 character vector where the names are column names in x and the values are column names in y.
These column names specify columns in x and y that define
closed (inclusive) starting and ending intervals. The column name
specifying the lower-bound column must be specified first.
these columns in x and y must all be of the same class and either be integer or IDate.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="intervalintersect_+3A_group_vars">group_vars</code></td>
<td>
<p>NULL, or either a character vector denoting the column name(s) in x and y,
or a named character vector where the name is the column name in x and the value is the column name in y.
This/these column(s) serve as an additional keying variable in the join (ie in addition to the interval join)
such that intervals in x will only be joined to overlapping in intervals in y where the group_vars values are the same.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="intervalintersect_+3A_interval_vars_out">interval_vars_out</code></td>
<td>
<p>The column names of the interval columns in the return data.table.
By default the return table will contain columns <code>c("start","end")</code>.
If your input tables already contain these columns,
you need to either specify <code>interval_vars_out</code> to be non-conflicting names with columns in x and y.
Or you rename columns in x and y to not contain columns named <code>c("start","end")</code>.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="intervalintersect_+3A_verbose">verbose</code></td>
<td>
<p>Prints additional information about the function processing.</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>All intervals are treated as closed (ie inclusive of the start and end values in the columns
specified by interval_vars)
</p>
<p>x and y are not copied but rather passed by reference to function internals
but the order of these data.tables is restored on function completion or error,
</p>
<p>Technically speaking this is just an inner cartesian join where the last two join variables are
doing a non-equi join for partial overlaps. Then each interval intersect is calculated using max and min.
</p>
<p>If there are columns with the same names in both x and y (including interval_vars
but excepting group_vars), the return value will still return both columns. The column in y
will be names as it was originally and the column in x will be prepended with the letter i followed with a dot:
<code>i.</code> <br />
</p>
<p>Note that the function returns the same result if you switch x and y
(with the exception of switched column names in the case of column name conflicts as just discussed)
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A data.table with columns <code>interval_vars_out</code> which denote the start and
stop period for each interval. This return table also contains columns in x and y. See details
for how naming conflicts are dealt with.
