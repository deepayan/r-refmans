<h3>Details</h3>

<p>brdta is a processed and coded survey response data to be fitted to the
hbbr model. It is a data frame in which 1st column contains ID of respondent,
2nd column contains response (y = 0 or 1) - each value corresponds to each
choice-pair card evaluated by the respondent: y =1 if the 1st choice of the
pair was preferred; 0 otherwise, 3rd column onwards contain information on
design matrix (X). Each row of X is a vector of indicator variables taking
values 0, 1, or -1; a value of 0 is used to denote absence of an attribute
level; a value of 1 or -1 is used to indicate presence of an attribute
level in the 1st choice, or in the 2nd choice, respectively in the choice-pair
presented to the respondent.
Note that column corresponding to the 1st level for each attribute would not be
included in X as the part-worth parameter (beta) for the 1st level of each attribute
is assumed to be 0 without loss of generality. So, if there are b benefit attributes
and r risk attributes, and then have bl_j and rl_k levels (j=1,...,b; k=1,...,r)
then total number of columns brdta is Sum_over_j(bl_j-1) + Sum_over_k(rl_k-1).
If there are B respondents, each responding to k choice-pairs, then brdta will
have B*k rows.
</p>
<p>tune.param is a list of tuning hyper-parameters (tau, eta) for the hbbr model.
Specifically, in the hbbr model beta.h ~ MVN(beta.bar, V.beta) where the hyper-prior
of beta.bar is assumed to be MVN (beta0, B) with B = 1/tau*I;  and
hyper-prior of V.beta is assumed to follow inverse Wishart IW(nue, V) with V = 1/eta*I.
When eta is NULL then eta will take the default value of m+3 which is the DF
for the Wishart distribution. If we think the respondents have very similar
part-worth vectors, then use eta=1.
</p>
<p>mcmc is a list of MCMC specification parameters:
(a) burnin - contains the number of burn-in values to be generated,
(b) iter - is the total number of iterations of each chain beyond burn-in,
(c) nc - is the number of independent chains, and
(d) thin = posterior samples to be saved for every 'thin' values of the MCMC
samples in each of the 'nc' chains. For more details see R2jags package help files.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>returns a list of useful output of interest and input specifications:
(bbar.mcmc, bbar.means, bbar.sds, summary, logL, design, model, brdata, other.inputs).

2nd column contains response (y = 0 or 1) - each value corresponds to each

level; a value of 1 or -1 is used to indicate presence of an attribute
level in the 1st choice, or in the 2nd choice, respectively in the choice-pair
presented to the respondent.
Note that column corresponding to the 1st level for each attribute would not be
included as the part-worth parameter (beta) for the 1st level of each attribute
is assumed to be 0 without loss of generality. So, if there are b benefit attributes
and r risk attributes, and then have bl_j and rl_k levels (j=1,...,b; k=1,...,r)
then total number of columns brdta is Sum_over_j(bl_j-1) + Sum_over_k(rl_k-1).
If there are B respondents each responding to k choice-pairs then brdta will
have B*k rows.

<p>tune.param is a list of tuning hyper-parameters (tau, eta) for the hbbr model.
Specifically, in the hbbr model beta.h ~ MVN(beta.bar, V.beta) where the hyper-prior

When eta is NULL then eta will take the default value of m+3 which is the DF

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The discrete choice experiment (DCE) included 3 benefit
attributes (b=3): overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR),
fatigue reduction (FTG);
and 2 risk attributes (r=2): febrile neutropenia (FebNEU) and severe pneumonia (SevPNA).
There were 4 levels for each of the benefit attributes (ORR, OS, and FTG)
(i.e. bl= rep(4,3)) and
3 levels for each of the 2 risk attributes (FebNEU and SevPNA)
(i.e. rl = rep(3,2)).
The DCE produced b*r*(4 choose 2)*(3 choose 2) = 108 distinct non-dominant choice
pairs each with one benefit and one
risk attribute. Panels (questionnaires) were generated with 18 randomly selected
choice pairs per panel from the set of 108 choice pairs.
Since the part-worth of various levels within each attribute are to be measured
relatively to the part-worth of the 1st level of the attribute, columns for
the 1st level of the attributes are not required. Thus, we have
sum(bl)-b + sum(br)-r = 13 columns are needed to
obtain information on the X matrix which are stored as the last 13 columns of brdta.

<dt>brdtaAug</dt><dd><p>A data frame of 100x12 rows and 10 columns consists of simulated responses from
100 subjects each providing tradeoff responses to 12 choice pairs. The 1st column consists of
subject id. The 2nd column contains binary responses (1 indicating 1st of the choice
pair was selected, 0 indicating 2nd was selected). Remaining 8 columns
contain the design matrix X taking values 0, 1, or -1; a value of 1 or -1 is used to
indicate presence of an attribute level in the 1st choice or in the 2nd choice of the choice
pair, respectively; a value of 0 is used to indicate absence of an attribute in the
choice pair.  See Details below for more about the discrete choice experiment that is coded as
design matrix X.</p>

The 1st  column being a constant vector of 1 indicates that the part-worth matrix to be estimated,
say Del-hat, would have the overall mean part-worth in the 1st column, while 2nd and 3rd

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The simulated discrete choice experiment (DCE) included 3 benefit
attributes (b=2): B1, B2 (say) and 2 risk attributes (r=2): R1, R2 (say).
There were 3 levels for each of the benefit attributes (&quot;Low&quot;, &quot;Moderate&quot;, &quot;High&quot;)
(i.e. bl= rep(3,2)) and
3 levels for each of the risk attributes (&quot;None&quot;, &quot;Mild&quot;, &quot;Severe&quot;)
(i.e. rl = rep(3,2)).
The DCE produced 36 distinct non-dominant choice pairs each with one benefit and one
risk attribute. Panels (questionnaires) were generated with 12 (randomly) selected
choice pairs per panel from the set of 36 choice pairs. Since the part-worth of various levels
within each attribute are to be measured relatively to the part-worth of the 1st level of the
attribute, columns for the 1st level of the attributes are not required. Thus, we have sum(bl)-b
+ sum(br)-r = 8 columns are needed to obtain information on the X matrix which are stored
as the last 8 columns of brdtaAugSim.
