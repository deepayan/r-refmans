<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Returns a matrix with the same dimensions as ymat and the same
pattern of NAs.  The returned value in position [i,j] compares
ymat[i,j] to the other observations in row i of ymat, scoring
the differences using <code class="reqn">\psi</code>-function, totalling them, and applying
a weight.  Matched sets of unequal size are weighted
using weights that would
be efficient in a randomization test under a simple model with
additive set and treatment effects and errors with constant variance.
See Rosenbaum (2007, section 4.2).
</p>
<p>When a matched set contains one control and several treated subjects,
this is reflected in the returned scores by a sign reversal.

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>In a full match, each matched set contains either one treated
individual and one or more controls or one control and one or

assignment.  For confidence intervals, use function senfmCI().

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>For the given <code class="reqn">\Gamma</code>, senfm() computes the upper bound on the 1-sided
P-value testing the null hypothesis
of an additive treatment effect tau against the alternative hypothesis of
a treatment effect larger than tau.  By default, senfm() tests the null hypothesis of
no treatment effect against the alternative of a positive treatment effect.
The P-value is an approximate P-value
based on a Normal approximation to the null distribution; see Rosenbaum (2007).
</p>
<p>Matched sets of unequal size are weighted using weights that would
be efficient in a randomization test under a simple model with
additive set and treatment effects and errors with constant variance;
see Rosenbaum (2007).
</p>
<p>The upper bound on the P-value is based on the separable approximation
described in Gastwirth, Krieger and Rosenbaum (2000); see also
Rosenbaum (2007).
</p>

<h3>Note</h3>

<p>The function senfm() performs 1-sided tests.  One approach
to a 2-sided, <code class="reqn">\alpha</code>-level test does both 1-sided tests
at level <code class="reqn">\alpha/2</code>, and rejects the null hypothesis if either
1-sided
test rejects.  Equivalently, a bound on the two sided
P-value is the smaller of 1 and twice the smaller of the two 1-sided
P-values.  This approach views a 2-sided test as two 1-sided tests
with a Bonferroni correction; see Cox (1977, Section 4.2).  In all
cases, this approach is valid large sample test: a true
null hypothesis is falsely
rejected with probability at most <code class="reqn">\alpha</code> if the bias in
treatment assignment is at most <code class="reqn">\Gamma</code>; so, this procedure
is entirely safe to use.  For a randomization test, <code class="reqn">\Gamma=1</code>, this
Bonferroni procedure is not typically conservative. For large <code class="reqn">\Gamma</code>,
this Bonferroni procedure tends to be somewhat conservative.
</p>
<p>Related packages are sensitivitymv, sensitivitymw and sensitivity2x2xk.
sensitivitymv is for matched sets with one treated
subject and a variable number of controls.
sensitivitymw is for matched sets with one treated subject and a fixed
number of controls, including matched pairs.  For their special cases,
sensitivitymv and sensitivitymw contain additional features not available
in sensitivityfull.  sensitivitymw is faster and computes confidence intervals
and point estimates.  sensitivitymw also implements methods
from Rosenbaum (2014).  sensitivity2x2xk is for 2x2xk contingency tables,
treatment x outcome x covariates; see Rosenbaum and Small (2016).
</p>
<p>Rosenbaum (2007) describes the method for matching with variable
numbers of controls, but only very minor adjustments are
required for full matching, and senfm() implements these
adjustments.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>For the given <code class="reqn">\Gamma</code>, senfmCI() inverts the test in the function
senfm() to produce the confidence interval.  That is, it tests every
<code class="reqn">\tau</code> and retains the values not rejected at level <code class="reqn">\alpha</code>.
</p>
<p>The test is a large sample approximation
based on a Normal approximation to the null distribution;
see Rosenbaum (2007).
</p>
<p>Matched sets of unequal size are weighted using weights that would
be efficient in a randomization test under a simple model with
additive set and treatment effects and errors with constant variance;
see Rosenbaum (2007).
</p>
<p>The upper bound on the P-value is based on the separable approximation
described in Gastwirth, Krieger and Rosenbaum (2000); see also
Rosenbaum (2007).

<h3>Note</h3>

<p>In a sensitivity analysis, a one-sided confidence interval is
not conservative; however, two-sided intervals formed
as the intersection of two one-sided <code class="reqn">1-\alpha/2</code>
intervals are somewhat conservative.  See the
discussion of two-sided tests in the documentation
for senfm().
