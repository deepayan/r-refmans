<h2 id='CHEMIST_package'>Causal Inference with High-Dimensional Error-Prone Covariates and
Misclassified Treatments</h2><span id='topic+CHEMIST_package'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The package CHEMIST, referred to Causal inference with High-dimsensional Error-
prone Covariates and MISclassified Treatments, aims to deal with the average
treatment effect (ATE), where the data are subject to high-dimensionality and
measurement error. This package primarily contains two functions: one is
Data_Gen that is applied to generate artificial data, including potential
outcomes, error-prone treatments and covariates, and the other is FATE that is
used to estimate ATE with measurement error correction.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>CHEMIST_package()
</code></pre>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This package aims to estimate ATE in the presence of high-dimensional and
error-prone data. The strategy is to do variable selection by feature screening
and general outcome-adaptive lasso. After that, measurement error in
covariates are corrected. Finally, with informative and error corrected data
obtained, the propensity score can be estimated and can be used to estimate
ATE by the inverse probability weight approach.
</p>

<h2 id='Data_Gen'>Generation of Artificial Data</h2><span id='topic+Data_Gen'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function shows the demonstration of data generation based on some
specific and commonly used settings, including exponential family distributed
potential outcomes, error-prone treatments, and covariates. In this function,
users can specify different magnitudes of measurement error and relationship
between outcome, treatment, and covariates.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>Data_Gen(
  X,
  alpha,
  beta,
  theta,
  a,
  sigma_e,
  e_distr = "normal",
  num_pi,

  linearY,
  typeY

<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table role = "presentation">

<p>The input of n x p dimensional matrix of true covariates, where n is
sample size and p is number of covariates. Users can customize the data structure

</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="Data_Gen_+3A_alpha">alpha</code></td>
<td>
<p>A vector of the parameters that reflects the relationship between

If components in <code>alpha</code> are zero but the same components in <code>beta</code> are
nonzero, we call them Xp (covariates associated with outcome only), If components
in <code>alpha</code> are nonzero but the same components in <code>beta</code> are zero, we
call them Xi (covariates associated with treatment only).
For example, if <code>alpha = c(2,2,0,0,1,1)</code> and <code>beta = c(3,3,1,1,0,0)</code>, then
the first two components are Xc, the middle two components are Xp, and the last two
