<td>Several functions that allow by different methods to infer a piecewise polynomial regression model under regularity constraints, namely continuity or differentiability of the link function. The implemented functions are either specific to data with two regimes, or generic for any number of regimes, which can be given by the user or learned by the algorithm. A paper describing all these methods will be submitted soon. The reference will be added to this file as soon as available. </td>

<h2 id='H2SPOR'>Inference method for two regimes</h2><span id='topic+H2SPOR'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>H2SPOR is an inference method that estimates, under regularity constraint, the parameters of a
polynomial regression model with 2 regimes.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>H2SPOR(X, Y, deg, constraint = 1, EM = TRUE, TimeTrans_Prop = c(),
  plotG = TRUE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table role = "presentation">

<td>
<p>A numerical vector corresponding to the explanatory variable. X must be sorted in ascending order
if this is not the case, X will be sorted in the function and the corresponding permutation will be applied to Y. The
user will be notified by a warning message. In addition, if X contains NAs, they will be deleted from the data and the user will be notified by a warning message.
Finally, if X contains duplicate data, the excess data will be deleted and the user will be notified by a warning message.</p>

the value of the remaining Y will become the average of the Ys, calculated for this value of X.</p>

(constraint = 0) or under assumption of differentiability (constraint = 2). Warning, if the differentiability
assumption is not verified by the model, it is preferable not to use it to estimate the model parameters.
