<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The Economic Policy Institute provides researchers, media, and the public with easily
accessible, up-to-date, and comprehensive historical data on the American labor force.
It is compiled from Economic Policy Institute analysis of government data sources. Use
it to research wages, inequality, and other economic indicators over time  and among
demographic groups. Data is usually updated monthly.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Set option 'epidata.show.citation' to 'FALSE' to suppress note and citation
messages. Remember, though, that EPI requires attribution if you use their data.

<h2 id='get_annual_wages_and_work_hours'>Retreive CPS ASEC Annual Wages and Work Hours</h2><span id='topic+get_annual_wages_and_work_hours'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Annual, weekly, and hourly wages and work hours show the average wages and work hours
of wage and salary workers using data from the CPS ASEC (also known as the March CPS).
Note that this data is not directly comparable to the CPS ORG data in median/average
hourly wage.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<h2 id='get_annual_wages_by_wage_group'>Annual wages by wage group</h2><span id='topic+get_annual_wages_by_wage_group'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Return the average annual salaries for select wage groups, with particular focus on
the highest wage earners. Note that this data is not directly comparable to wage
deciles/percentiles.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>get_annual_wages_by_wage_group()
</code></pre>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Wages are in 2017 dollars. Population sample: All workers.
</p>
<p>The average annual wages by wage group are taken from a 2010 article by Wojciech Kopczuk,
Emmanuel Saez, and Jae Song. To extend this series, data for 2006 through 2017 are
extrapolated from 2004 data using changes in wage shares computed from Social Security
Administration wage statistics. We employ the midpoint of the bracket to compute total
wage income in each bracket and sum all brackets. We then use interpolation to derive
percentile cutoffs building from the bottom up to obtain the 0–90th percentile bracket
and then estimate the remaining categories. This allows us to estimate the wage shares
for upper wage groups. We use these wage shares computed for 2004 and later years to
extend the Kopczuk, Saez, and Song series by adding the changes in share between 2004
and the relevant year to their series. To obtain absolute wage trends we use the SSA data
on the total wage pool and employment and compute the real wage per worker (based on t
heir share of wages and employment) in the different groups in 2017 dollars. For a
detailed explanation, see the methodology for annual wages and hours.
