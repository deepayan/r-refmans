<h2 id='fstcore-package'>R bindings to the fstlib library</h2><span id='topic+fstcore-package'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>R package <code>fstcore</code> contains R bindings to the C++ <code>fstlib</code> library which allows interfacing with <em>fst</em> files.
It also contains the <code>LZ4</code> and <code>ZSTD</code> sources used for compression. <code>fstcore</code> exists as a package separate from the
<code>fst</code> package to facilitate independent updates to the <code>fstlib</code>, <code>LZ4</code> and <code>ZSTD</code> libraries and is used as a
backend to <code>fst</code>.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The fstcore package is based on six C++ libraries or components:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><strong>fstlib</strong>: library containing code to write, read and compute on files stored in the <em>fst</em> format.
Written and owned by Mark Klik.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>LZ4</strong>: library containing code to compress data with the LZ4 compressor. Written and owned
by Yann Collet.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>ZSTD</strong>: library containing code to compress data with the ZSTD compressor. Written by
Yann Collet and owned by Facebook, Inc.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>libdivsufsort-lite</strong>: a  lightweight suffix array construction algorithm. This code is bundled with
the ZSTD compression library. Written and owned by Yuta Mori.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>sources from zstdmt</strong>: a multithreading library for Brotli, Lizard, LZ4, LZ5 and Zstandard.  This code is
bundled with the ZSTD library. Written and owned by Tino Reichardt.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>source file zstd_opt.h</strong>: Price functions for optimal parser. Written and owned by Yann Collet and Przemyslaw
Skibinski. This code is bundled with the ZSTD library.
</p>
</li></ul>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Display versioning information of fstcore library dependencies
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>lib_versions()
</code></pre>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>a list with library versions
</p>

<hr>
<h2 id='threads_fstlib'>Get or set the number of threads used in parallel operations</h2><span id='topic+threads_fstlib'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>For parallel operations, the performance is determined to a great extend by the number of threads
used. More threads will allow the CPU to perform more computational intensive tasks simultaneously,
speeding up the operation. Using more threads also introduces some overhead that will scale with the
number of threads used. Therefore, using the maximum number of available threads is not always the
fastest solution. With <code>threads_fstlib</code> the number of threads can be adjusted to the users
specific requirements. As a default, <code>fstcore</code> uses a number of threads equal to the number of
logical cores in the system.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>threads_fstlib(nr_of_threads = NULL, reset_after_fork = NULL)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr><td><code id="threads_fstlib_+3A_nr_of_threads">nr_of_threads</code></td>
<td>
<p>number of threads to use or <code>NULL</code> to get the current number of threads used in
multithreaded operations.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="threads_fstlib_+3A_reset_after_fork">reset_after_fork</code></td>
<td>
<p>when <code>fstcore</code> is running in a forked process, the usage of OpenMP can
create problems. To prevent these, <code>fstcore</code> switches back to single core usage when it detects a fork.
After the fork, the number of threads is reset to it's initial setting. However, on some compilers
(e.g. Intel), switching back to multi-threaded mode can lead to issues. When <code>reset_after_fork</code>
is set to <code>FALSE</code>, <code>fstcore</code> is left in single-threaded mode after the fork ends. After the fork,
multithreading can be activated again manually by calling <code>threads_fstlib</code> with an appropriate value
for <code>nr_of_threads</code>. The default (<code>reset_after_fork = NULL</code>) leaves the fork behavior unchanged.</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The number of threads can also be set with <code>options(fst_threads = N)</code>.
NOTE: This option is only read when the package's namespace is first loaded, with commands like
<code>library</code>, <code>require</code>, or <code>::</code>. If you have already used one of these, you
must use <code>threads_fstlib</code> to set the number of threads.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>the number of threads (previously) used
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'># get current number of threads
threads_fstlib()

# set the number of threads
threads_fstlib(12)

# leave in single threaded mode after a fork
threads_fstlib(12, reset_after_fork = FALSE)

# reset number of threads after a fork
threads_fstlib(12, reset_after_fork = TRUE)
</code></pre>
