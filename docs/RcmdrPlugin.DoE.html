<h2 id='RcmdrPlugin.DoE-package'>R-Commander plugin package that implements design of experiments facilities 
from packages DoE.base, FrF2 and DoE.wrapper into the R-Commander</h2><span id='topic+RcmdrPlugin.DoE-package'></span><span id='topic+RcmdrPlugin.DoE'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The plugin adds a Design menu to the R-Commander. From this, various types of 
experimental plans can be generated, imported, augmented with responses or further runs, 
and - in a limited way - analysed. Of course, other R-Commander functionality can 
also be used on the designs.
</p>
<p>The plugin is currently a beta version. Reports on bugs or inconveniences are 
very welcome.
</p>


<h3>Prior Remark for Windows users</h3>

<p>The R GUI should be installed with the Single Document Interface (SDI) mode 
instead of the default MDI mode. John Fox, the author of R-Commander, has described 
how to change MDI to SDI, if R has been installed in the wrong mode. 
It is strongly discouraged to run the R-Commander under the MDI mode, 
as it happens very frequently that windows suddenly disappear. They usually 
have iconized only and can be retrieved from the taskbar; nevertheless, this behavior 
can be very annoying and can be avoided by using R in SDI mode.</p>


<h3>Suggests field is not meant as a suggestion</h3>

<p>For ensuring valid checks of package <span class="pkg">RcmdrPlugin.DoE</span>, 
it was necessary to include package <span class="pkg">FrF2.catlg128</span> under suggested packages. 
Note that most users will not need that package and should not install it.
</p>


<h3>Beta Version!</h3>

<p><span class="pkg">RcmdrPlugin.DoE</span> is currently in beta shape. The calculation functions have 
been reasonably tested within the underlying calculation packages. Usage of the menus 
has of course also been tested, but there are very likely untested scenarios where 
something does not work properly. Bug reports are therefore invited!
</p>
<p>The logged commands are currently aiming to be correct but not to be didactic, 
since they have been generated with the purpose to obtain a valid result from the inputs with as 
little programming effort as possible. They often contain many superfluous inputs, 
since default inputs could also be omitted. For example, while <code>FrF2(8,4)</code> would 
produce a regular fractional factorial design with 8 runs, 4 factors and default factor names and levels, 
the respective logged command is three rows long.
</p>
<p>The help files will have to be improved upon. Suggestions are welcome (where did you get stuck?).
</p>
<p>Current users of this package have to accept acting as beta testers. 
It is particularly important to never work with the one and only data original, but have 
the valuable experimental data themselves stored in a safe place.
</p>


<h3>Covered methodology and planned extensions</h3>

<p>Full factorial designs, orthogonal main effects designs, 
regular and non-regular 2-level fractional factorial designs, central composite and Box-Behnken 
designs, latin hypercube samples, and simple D-optimal designs can currently be generated from the GUI.
</p>
<p>Extensions to cover further latin hypercube designs as well as more advanced 
D-optimal designs (with blocking) are planned for the future.
</p>
<p><span class="pkg">RcmdrPlugin.DoE</span> implements functionality from packages <span class="pkg">DoE.base</span>, <span class="pkg">FrF2</span>, 
<span class="pkg">DoE.wrapper</span> (which in turn implements functionality from several other packages), 
and also from package <span class="pkg">rsm</span>. All package allow more flexibility through command line 
programming than through using the GUI. Nevertheless, usage of the GUI should be sufficient 
for reasonable creation and analysis of results at least in standard situations.
</p>
<p>There is a tutorial (see references) with example data; it is, however, far from 
being comprehensive. For experienced users of other DoE Software, 
the menus may be reasonably self-explanatory. Please feel free to contact me with issues 
regarding the documentation; it is very informative and will help improve documentation, 
if I understand where users get stuck. However, I am of course NOT a help desk for experimentation or 
issues with using R or the R-Commander.

<h2 id='DoEGlossary'>Glossary for DoE terminology as used in RcmdrPlugin.DoE</h2><span id='topic+DoEGlossary'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This glossary is intended for users who have heard about the concepts of 
experimental design, orthogonality, and so forth but would nevertheless 
like to look up some of the terminology.
</p>
<p>It can of course not replace a good training or a good book on experimental 
design.</p>


<h3>Glossary</h3>


<dl>
<dt>star</dt><dd> 
<p>A <code>*</code> indicates a paragraph or section, that requires more 
statistical understanding than necessary for successful application of 
experimentation and can be skipped by readers who do not want to go in too deeply. 
Do not confuse with resolution III*.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>2fi</dt><dd>
<p>short for 2-factor interaction: 
The effect of a factor depends on the level of a second factor, 
e.g. in a sled test example reported in Grove and Davis, 1992 (p.25 f.), 
speed of airbag inflation shows almost no effect on chest acceleration for 
the smaller airbag in the experiment, while a higher speed strongly decreases 
chest acceleration for the larger air bag. 
One can also look at this example the other way round: 
For high speed, increasing the airbag size reduces chest acceleration, 
while for low speed, increasing the airbag size increases chest acceleration.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>2-level fractional factorial</dt><dd>
<p>A 2-level array is a row-by-column table, 
each column of which contains two distinct values only. 
A &ldquo;2-level orthogonal array&rdquo; is a 2-level array with particular balance 
properties: If for each column, one value is denoted by -1 and the other by +1, 
the element wise product of any pair of two columns always sums to 0. 
This provides an easy means of checking for orthogonality of any 2-level array. 
Balance of the example plan can be expressed verbally as follows: 
Each possible level combination of two factors in the plan occurs equally often, 
e.g. short float rod/small tank, long float rod/small tank, short float rod/large tank, 
long float rod/large tank each occur twice.
A &ldquo;regular 2-level fractional factorial&rdquo; is a special 2-level orthogonal 
array, for which all effects are either fully aliased or not aliased at all (no 
partial aliasing). 
A &ldquo;non-regular 2-level fractional factorial&rdquo; is a 2-level orthogonal 
array, for which partial aliasing occurs. 
</p>
</dd>
<dt>aberration</dt><dd>
<p><code>*</code>Roughly, aberration is a criterion for comparing two designs of the same resolution: 
the design is better if aberration is smaller. 
Aberration measures the extent of the most severe aliasing: 
The larger the aberration, the more aliasing of the most severe type 
(resolution III: main effect with 2fi, resolution IV: 2fi with 2fi 
(and main effect with 3-factor interaction, not listed in tables of CATALOGUE.XLS)) 
is present in the design.
Technically, aberration is the number of shortest words.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>active effect</dt><dd>
<p>An effect is said to be &ldquo;active&rdquo;, if it does have an influence on the 
response, and inactive otherwise. 
</p>
</dd>
<dt>aliasing</dt><dd>
<p>Two effects are said to be completely aliased, 
if they cannot be seperated from each other by the design. 
An extreme example would be running an experiment on tires such that 
large tires of material 1 are compared to small tires of material 2. 
As there are neither large tires of material 2 nor small tires of material 1, 
the main effects of tire size and material are completely aliased. 
(Designs with aliasing between main effects would be resolution II and are not 
implemented in package <span class="pkg">FrF2</span>.
If one really intends to alias two main effects with each other, 
one can always combine them into one, e.g. in the above example the combined 
factor could be called &ldquo;tire&rdquo;.) 
Likewise, aliasing between other effects like between two 2fis or between a main effect 
and a 2fi means that the effects cannot be separated from each other by the design. 
More technically, in the present context, aliasing refers to structurally 
determined identity between several effects that arises in fractional factorials.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Design</dt><dd>
<p>&ldquo;Design&rdquo; is the shortest term for an experimental plan or experimental layout.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Degrees of freedom (df)</dt><dd>
<p>The data contain a certain number n of independent pieces of information, 
e.g. in case of a designed experiment we have the number of experimental runs 
(or a multiple of this number in case of proper replication). 
In any case, one needs to estimate the overall average from the responses of 
the experiment so that there are n - 1 independent pieces of information left. 
These are the &ldquo;degrees of freedom&rdquo; to start with. 
We then introduce factors the effects of which we want to estimate. 
Each effect has degrees of freedom (df) associated with it, 
e.g. the df for the main effect of a 2-level factor are 1 (=2-1), 
while the df for the main effect of a 4-level factor would be 3 (=4-1). 
In total, the sum of the df of all effects that we estimate cannot exceed the 
df that we have gained from collecting data. 
If we subtract the df for each effect that is estimated from the overall df, 
the remaining number are the so-called error degrees of freedom or residual df. 
In DoE, we often &ldquo;saturate&rdquo; models, 
i.e. we assign all available degrees of  freedom to effects so that residual df are 0. 
In this case, the only way of assessing whether or not an effect is active is 
by halfnormal plots, full-normal plots, or effects Paretos; 
&ldquo;proper&rdquo; statistical analysis like Analysis of Variance does require some 
error degrees of freedom.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>DoE</dt><dd>
<p>Design of experiment, also experimental design: 
The statistical discipline that takes care of planning / designing experiments. 
Some people also use this expression for the design itself, or for the whole 
process of running a designed experiment.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>D-optimal</dt><dd>
<p>A D-optimal design minimizes the volume of the confidence ellipsoid for the model 
coefficients (by maximizing the determinant of the model information matrix); 
requires that a model is specified in advance
</p>
</dd>
<dt>effect</dt><dd>
<p>The term &ldquo;effect&rdquo; stands for all kinds of impact that a factor or a 
combination of factors can have on the response. Effect summarizes main effects, 
2fis, and even higher-order interactions in one expression. 
It is also customary to split main effects of multilevel factors into several 
contributions, e.g. the main effect of a 3-level factor may be split 
into a linear and a quadratic effect. 
Strictly speaking, the effects are the theoretically &ldquo;true&rdquo; impacts on 
the response, that cannot be observed in an experiment, as there always 
is experimental error (in CAE experiments, there is often no random error, 
but there is model error instead). 
Sometimes, the term effect is also used for the estimated effects, 
but one should always bear in mind that estimated effects are subject to 
experimental error and / or model error and / or possible aliasing, 
so that they are indicative of true effects, but need to be verified 
(e.g. by confirmation runs, cf. Grove and Davis, 1992, p.83).
</p>
</dd>
<dt>estimate</dt><dd>
<p>When running an experiment (setting aside CAE), the response is subject 
to measurement error and many other sources of random or systematic deviation 
from <code>the truth</code>. Therefore, effects will not be known after the experiment, 
but can only be <code>estimated</code>. For estimating a main effect of a 2-level factor, 
for example, one has to calculate the difference between the average response 
for the two levels. Using the term &ldquo;estimating&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;calculating&rdquo; 
emphasizes the fact that there is some variation involved in the actually 
calculated numbers, as using a different part, or measuring on a different 
machine or under different environmental conditions (or ...) would have 
returned a different number.
With CAE, things are somewhat different: In a CAE experiment, there is often no 
measurement error (or very little from computational inaccuracies), 
but there almost certainly is model error, i.e. the CAE model does not 
perfectly reflect reality. Hence, any CAE experiment yields insights into 
model reality, but not necessarily into real world reality.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>experiment</dt><dd>
<p>&ldquo;By an experiment we mean any test, evaluation or trial designed 
to evaluate a change, which requires the collection of measurements (data) 
so that a judgment (prediction) on the performance of the siystem can be formed, 
and a decision can be made as to whether further re-design 
(with further experimentation and prediction) is necessary.&rdquo; 
(cited from Grove and Davis, 1992, p.1) 
In this glossary, the term is used in a more restricted sense for a 
statistically designed experiment, in which experimentation is done following 
an experimental plan in a number of factors, each of which has a predetermined set of levels.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>factor</dt><dd>
<p>A factor is a characteristic of the system under study that is to be systematically varied over a predetermined set of levels in an experiment.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>fractional factorial</dt><dd>
<p>A regular fractional factorial is a design obtained from a full factorial in fewer factors by deliberately 
assigning additional factors to particular interactions (i.e. by choosing generating contrasts), 
thereby introducing perfect aliasing between some effects. One can also start 
from the full factorial in all factors, and state that a regular fractional 
factorial is a design obtained by taking a regular (!) fraction of the full factorial only. 
This notion is closer to the expression, of course.<br />
A non-regular fractional factorial analogously takes a non-regular fraction of the experiment 
one would have to run in case of a full factorial. 
</p>
</dd>
<dt>full factorial</dt><dd>
<p>A full factorial is a design that consists of every possible combination of levels 
of all the factors. A full factorial of <code>k</code> 2-level factors has <code>2^k</code> runs (if unreplicated).
</p>
</dd>
<dt>generating contrast</dt><dd>
<p>A generating contrast or &ldquo;generator&rdquo; is needed for generating regular 
fractional factorials. It is obtained by assigning an 
additional factor to an interaction column from a full factorial, 
e.g. ABCDE=I when assigning the additional factor E to the 4-factor interaction 
ABCD in a 16-run design: 
As E equals ABCD in this case, the product of ABCD with E yields a constant 
column of + (=+1), which is denoted by I.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>base factors</dt><dd>
<p>The <code>k</code> 2-level factors making up a <code>2^k</code> run full factorial design 
are called the base factors. They can be used for generating a regular 2-level 
fractional factorial. 
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Hadamard matrix</dt><dd>
<p><code>*</code>A (transposed) Hadamard matrix is a matrix of -1 and +1 such that all 
columns of the matrix are orthogonal. All orthogonal 2-level arrays can be 
understood as square Hadamard matrices (when adding a first column of solely +1s). 
Likewise, any square Hadamard matrix with a first column of solely +1s can be 
used for creating an orthogonal array for 2-level factors.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>half-normal plot</dt><dd>
<p>The half-normal plot is also called Daniel plot, according to Daniel (1959). 
The idea is as follows: if all factors have no impact on the response, the 
estimated effects are random numbers with mean 0 and some variance and should 
roughly follow a normal distribution. The absolute values of these estimated 
effects thus follow the so-called half-normal distribution. 
Now, we can depict the sorted standardized absolute effects against the theoretical 
quantiles of the standard halfnormal distribution (plotting positions). 
The plotting positions are chosen such that the effects lie nicely on a line, 
if they behave like normally distributed random numbers with mean 0. 
In the context of DoE, one usually hopes that most effects lie on a line through 
the origin, while a few effects are distinctly larger than the continuation of the line. 
Those effects that stick out well above (or to the right of) the line are considered 
&ldquo;active&rdquo;, as they are larger than what one would expect from the size of 
random variation within the experiment. 
</p>
<p>If the eye-balled line does not point towards the origin, this often indicates presence of an outlier.
</p>
<p>Caution: Occasionally, although some effects stick out dramatically, 
the largest effect almost lies on the eye-balled line. It is unreasonable to 
argue that the largest effect is inactive but smaller effects are active. 
Whenever a particular effect is considered active, all larger (in absolute value) 
effects have to be considered active as well. 
</p>
<p>Interpretation of half-normal plots, in case of non-ideal appearance, 
requires careful thinking, looking for outliers, ...
Half-normal plots should be used with great care or not at all in experiments with few runs only 
(e.g. 8 run experiments). If replications are present, it can be better to use analysis of 
variance (provided the replications of one and the same run represent all kinds 
of random variation that may be encountered between runs) than to use half-normal plots. 
Whenever half-normal plots are used, one should include all effects - also those associated with empty columns - in the plot.
Therefore, screening designs created by RcmdrPlugin.DoE include those empty columns per default.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>hereditary principle</dt><dd>
<p>The idea that an interaction is less likely to be important if one or both of the 
involved main effects are inactive, is called the &ldquo;hereditary principle&rdquo;. 
In case of aliasing between two 2fis, if the interaction column that hosts the 
two aliased 2fis, is estimated to have a considerable effect, the hereditary principle 
can sometimes be used to resolve the issue which of the two 2fis is responsible 
for this finding: 
If one of the two 2fis involves a main effect that is not estimated to be important, 
while for the other both the involved main effects are estimated to be important, 
the hereditary principle suggests that the 2fi with two &ldquo;parents&rdquo; is 
the likely responsible. Nevertheless, it is possible that a 2fi is truly important, 
although only one (or even none) of the two involved main effects is active. 
Therefore, in case of ambiguity it is always a good idea to do confirmation runs 
or follow-up experiments.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>I</dt><dd>
<p>I denotes a constant column of + (or +1, depending on notation) of appropriate length. 
Therefore, the letter <code>I</code> is not used for factor names (neither is <code>i</code>).
</p>
</dd>
<dt>interaction</dt><dd>
<p>It is possible that the main effect of a factor <code>B</code> given the first level 
of a factor <code>A</code> is substantially different from the main effect of factor <code>B</code> given the second level 
of factor <code>A</code> . In this case, it is said that there is a 2-factor interaction between factors <code>A</code> and <code>B</code>. 
One can extend the concept of interactions to multi-factor interactions 
(also called higher-order interactions). 
In practice, however, interactions between more than 2 factors are very rarely 
considered important and are very difficult to interpret. 
</p>
</dd>
<dt>latin hypercube</dt><dd>
<p>Computer experiments usually do not benefit from repeating runs, because the 
results will be virtually the same. Therefore, one tries to use designs that 
do not produce replications when projected into lower-dimensional space (e.g. 
for modelling with a few factors that turn out to be relevant only). Latin hypercube 
designs or latin hypercube samples have as many levels for each factor as there are 
runs. Usually, one tries to choose level combinations such that the design 
is &ldquo;space-filling&rdquo;, i.e. fills the experimental space with points so that 
the experiment provides information everywhere in the experimental region.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>level</dt><dd>
<p>A level is one of the predetermined settings over which a factor is varied 
(usually very few, in package <span class="pkg">FrF2</span> mostly two, sometimes also four (not yet implemented). 
For example, the factor temperature could have the two levels 0 and 20 degree Celsius.
Determining the levels of a factor is a very important step in planning an experiment, 
as the results might be very different, when looking at e.g. 
-15 and 35 degree Celsius instead of 0 and 20.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>linear effect, quadratic effect</dt><dd>
<p>For a quantitative factor, the response can be modeled as a linear function of 
the size of the factor, i.e. denoting the response by <code>y</code> and the factors 
value by <code>x</code>, we can write <code>y=a+bx</code>. 
If the factor has 2 levels only in the experiment, we can estimate <code>b</code> 
from the data, but it is impossible to check, whether the factors effect on the 
response is well-approximated by a linear function. 
If the factor has more than 2 levels, we can find out, whether a linear function 
is appropriate, e.g. by additionally fitting a quadratic effect, <code>y=a+bx+cx^2</code>. 
In 2-level experiments with quantitative factors, it is also customary to incorporate 
a few so-called center points, which are in the middle between extremes for all factors. 
By comparing their average to the average results from the other points, linearity 
can be checked.
</p>
</dd><dt>main effect</dt><dd>
<p>The main effect for a 2-level factor is defined as the (true) difference between 
the (true) responses for the two levels of the factor. It is estimated by the 
difference between the averages of measured responses for the two levels of the factor. 
Often, the term &ldquo;main effect&rdquo; is used for the true unobservable difference 
as well as for the estimated effect from an experiment. 
It is, however, useful to be aware that there is a difference, that is due to measurement error, aliasing, ... 
</p>
<p>The main effect for factors with more than two levels is made up of several 
components or degrees of freedom (df),  where df = (levels - 1). 
For a quantitative 3-level factor (2 df), one often talks about the linear and the 
quadratic effect, which can in case of equi-distant levels be estimated by 
the difference between the average responses of the high and the low level (linear effect) 
and by the difference of the average response of the middle level from the 
average response of the two outer levels (quadratic effect). 
Likewise, one can discuss linear, quadratic, and cubic effects for 4-level factors and so on. 
For qualitative factors - e.g. type of material, shape of gasket etc. - one possibility is to define 
a reference category, e.g. the current level, and to formulate the main effect in 
terms of the difference of the response on each level to the response for the reference category.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Median</dt><dd>
<p>For obtaining the median of a group of values, first sort the values by size. 
For an odd number of values, the median is the middle value in the sorted series. 
For an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle values of the sorted series. 
Thus, the median is a value that splits the data into a bottom and a top half.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>mixed level orthogonal array</dt><dd>
<p>An orthogonal array that contains factors with both 2 level and 3 levels is called 
a &ldquo;mixed level orthogonal array&rdquo; or &ldquo;mixed level array&rdquo;. 
Such arrays are implemented under menu &ldquo;General Factorial&rdquo;.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>naming convention for factors</dt><dd>
<p>It is a convention that factors in experimental plans are abbreviated by capitalized 
letters from the alphabet, where usually the letter <code>I</code> is skipped as it has 
a special meaning in the literature on experimental plans. Once one runs out 
of capital letters as there are more than 25 factors, conventions are less unique; 
some people use numbers, others small letters (e.g. default in this software or Minitab), .... 
If the small letters are also exhausted, this software uses F1, F2, ... 
</p>
<p>Interactions in 2-level fractional factorials are denoted by the ordered sequence 
of factor names of the factors involved, e.g. AB denotes the 2fi between factors A and B,  
BEFH denotes the four factor interaction between the four included factors. 
These sequences of letters can be used simultaneously for naming the appropriate column 
in the design and for naming the whole interaction effect.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Plackett-Burman designs</dt><dd>
<p>Plackett and Burman (1946) introduced 2-level orthogonal arrays that are not obtained 
as regular fractional factorials. If the number of runs is not a power of 1, 
these designs have any particular interaction partially aliased 
with several main effects, so that on the one hand we don't find unconfounded 
main effects, but on the other hand, no main effect is completely distorted by 
a single interaction effect. Note that these designs cannot be used for 
estimating interactions or for constructing 4-level factors from a pair of 2-level factors. 
However, a few subsequent analyses have been proposed to use these designs for modelling after 
using them for screening (requires expert knowledge, not included in this software).
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Projection properties, projectivity</dt><dd>
<p>The term &ldquo;projection properties&rdquo; refers to the properties of a design, 
when attention is restricted to a few (seemingly) active factors only, 
for example in the case of screening designs, where some factors are ruled out 
as unimportant. A design is said to be of projectivity 3, if it contains at least 
one full factorial (plus possibly some repeat runs) in any triple of three factors. 
Analogously, a design is said to be of projectivity 4, if it contains at least one 
full factorial (plus possibly some repeat runs) in any set of four factors etc. 
For Plackett-Burman designs, projection properties have been studied in detail by 
Lin and Draper (1992), Draper and Lin (1995) and Box and Tyssedal (1996). 
The work on 16 run Hadamard matrices by Box and Tyssedal (2001) 
is also based on projection properties. It forms the basis of the 16 run screening 
designs used per default in this software.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>randomize</dt><dd>
<p>Randomization is a means of trying to avoid effects of unknown factors that may 
for example change over time. In the DoE context, it is advisable to randomize the 
run order, as time might introduce unexpected effects that can lead to misleading 
results. Randomizing is the default for all experiments, except if hard-to-change 
factors are declared. 
</p>
<p>Since experimentation without randomization runs great risks particularly in 
case of very systematic run orders like the one used for hard-to-change factors, 
one should normally strive to run an experiment in randomized order. 
However, if the experiment becomes *much* more difficult this way, it may be acceptable 
to deviate from this rule.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>replication/repetition</dt><dd>
<p>Both replication and repetition stand for repeating a measurement with exactly 
the same configuration of factor levels. The difference between these two concepts 
is as follows (cf. Grove and Davis, 1992, p.155/p.198):
Replication should ideally reflect all possibilities of experimental error; for example, 
if installing a part in the system may cause variation, replication of a run should 
not just install a part once and measure the response twice, but should at least re-install 
the part before re-measuring. Better even, a different part with the same configuration 
should be installed for also capturing part-to-part variation. 
</p>
<p>In many cases, it may be more useful to run a genuine 16-run design instead of 
twice replicating an 8-run design. 
Cost may be a driver of using replication instead of a truly larger design, 
and the desire for a good estimate of experimental variability may be another 
driver for replication.
</p>
<p>Repetition mainly refers to production and measurement processes. 
It should not introduce experimental error but rather reflect just the errors 
that one can expect to occur in normal production or measurement. For example, 
if some factors refer to machine setup for producing some parts, repetition 
means that the machine is setup once, and several parts are produced under the same setup.
</p>
<p>Per default, this software considers proper replications. These are randomized in blocks, 
such that the first replicate of each run in randomized order is conducted before 
the second replication of any run starts. Under option &ldquo;repeat.only&rdquo;, 
repeated runs occur all together in a row, assuming that they are repeated measurements. 
</p>
</dd>
<dt>resolution</dt><dd>
<p>Resolution is the smallest possible number of factors that appears in a pair of aliased effects, 
e.g. if there is an alias between a main effect and a 2fi, the resolution is III 
(resolution is usually denoted in Roman numbers). 
More technically speaking, resolution is the length of the shortest word.
</p>
<p>The literature sometimes uses resolution <code>III*</code> for designs of resolution III 
with specific favourable properties. These will be made use of in the future. They have not been implemented yet.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>response</dt><dd>
<p>In an experiment, the response is a quantity that quantifies the performance of 
the system under investigation. It can be a measurement itself, a quantity calculated 
from several measurements, ...
</p>
</dd>
<dt>response surface design</dt><dd>
<p>Experimental plans that are meant to model the response as a smooth function of a 
set of quantitative factors - often second order, i.e. including quadratics of 
each factor and linear by linear interactions between each pair of factors - 
are called response surface designs. Such designs can be created by augmenting 
appropriate regular 2-level fractional factorial designs with center and star points.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>robustness experiment</dt><dd>
<p>A robustness experiment (or robustness study) is dedicated to finding factors 
(so-called control factors) that can be used in designing the product (or process) 
for making the response insensitive (=robust) to so-called noise factors that 
cannot be influenced by the engineer (like customer usage conditions, outside temperature, ...). 
For analysis of data from robustness experiments (setting aside the famous but 
questionable S/N ratio approach, cf. e.g. Grove and Davis 1992, Chapter 11), 
2fis between noise factors and control factors are extremely important.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>run</dt><dd>
<p>Any configuration of factor levels for which a response is recorded is called a run. 
Some people use the term &ldquo;run&rdquo; for distinct configurations only so that an 
8-run design with 2 replications would still be called an 8-run design, 
while other people would call such a design a 16-run design. This software 
adopts the first view.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>run order</dt><dd>
<p>Run order refers to the temporal order in which the runs in an experiment 
are arranged. Usually, the run order should be randomized. However, it is nevertheless 
often helpful for thinking about the experimental structure, if one can look at the 
experiment in standard order. Therefore, the attribute run.order of all designs 
allows to switch back and forth between randomized and standard order. 
</p>
</dd><dt>clear</dt><dd>
<p>&ldquo;clear&rdquo; refers to the absence of aliasing. It is customary in the literature 
to talk of effects of being clear if they are neither aliased with a main effect 
nor with a 2fi. They may be aliased with higher-order interactions. 
</p>
</dd>
<dt>WLP</dt><dd>
<p><code>*</code>short for &ldquo;Word length pattern&rdquo;, cf. &ldquo;word&rdquo;
</p>
</dd>
<dt>word</dt><dd>
<p>*For regular 2-level fractional factorial designs, any product of factors that 
resolves to <code>I</code> is termed a word. For example, if the product CDEF yields 
a constant column of &ldquo;+1&rdquo;, CDEF is a word of length four 
(as there are four factors involved). The number of (non-trivial) words for 
a design is <code>2^g-1</code> with <code>g</code> denoting the number of generating contrasts.
</p>
<p>For irregular designs and mixed-level designs, it is possible to determine the 
number of generalized words (usually of lengths 3 and 4), by summing up the 
scalar products of the intercept column with all length 3 or 4 combinations of 
orthogonal effect columns for three or four different factors (Xu and Wu 2001).
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Yates order</dt><dd>
<p>Frank Yates is a renowned experimenter, who found an ordering of the rows of 
an experiment that made it easy to calculate effects even in the absence of computers. 
Originally, &ldquo;Yates order&rdquo; is the term for this order of the rows. 
It is now customary to list the columns in the exactly analogous order as well: 
This order comes about by appending each new factor as the last column and then appending 
its products with all the preceding columns in the order of occurrence. 
This leads to the sequence  A, B, AB,    C,    AC, BC, ABC,     D,   AD, BD, ABD, CD, ... 
It can therefore be said that the columns are listed in Yates order, 
although &ldquo;Yates order&rdquo; originally referred to the order of the rows. 
</p>
<p>The list <code>Yates</code> in this software indicates for each column position, which factors 
are involved in the respective effect. The column numbers of the thus-obtained matrix are 
a customary way to denote generating contrasts in the literature on 2-level fractional factorials.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>It is discouraged to edit design objects from within R. Users should export the 
design and re-import it after adding response data.
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it is possible to add response values by adding numeric columns to 
the design with the editor (never edit factors!), 
and users will have to attach the responses added 
to an edited design to their original design afterwards, using e.g. the <br />
Modify design -&gt; Add response variables ...<br />
menu, providing the edited data set as the R object that contains the responses.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>a data.frame with <code>.edited</code> appended to the original design name 
and without any class design properties.
</p>
<p>If editing involved adding response data, the edited file can be used 
for adding respones to the design object (see Details section).

<h3>Warning </h3>

<p>Editing a class design object is seldom useful.

<h2 id='Menu.2level'>2-level factorial designs</h2><span id='topic+Menu.2level'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>There are two types of orthogonal 2-level factorial designs, 
regular fractional factorial designs and screening designs. This 
help file is about when to apply these.</p>


<h3>Quantitative or Qualitative</h3>

<p>Both types of design are suitable for quantitative and qualitative factors alike. 
</p>


<h3>Screening designs or Plackett-Burman designs</h3>

<p>Screening designs are particularly useful, if the experiment is intended to pick a few 
important factors out of a list of many candidate factors. It often can not be ruled out 
that factors interact with each other, but the interactions are not of interest at the 
screening stage. If the main effects are stronger than the interactions, which is very often 
the case, the screening experiment has a good chance of selecting the key factors 
for further experimentation. With very high expertise and some luck, a screening 
experiment might even be sufficient to draw further conclusions.
</p>


<h3>Regular (fractional) factorial designs</h3>

<p>Regular Fractional Factorial designs of resolution III are also sometimes used for 
screening. If the aliasing is not too severe, if e.g. just three main effects are aliased with 
one 2-factor interaction each (i.e. one word of length three), this can be reasonable. However, 
with more severe aliasing, using a resolution III design is more risky than using a screening design, 
because main effects are completely aliased with 2-factor interactions, which can lead to severe bias and 
wrong conclusions. 
</p>
<p>Regular (Fractional) Factorial designs of resolution IV or higher are particularly 
useful, if not only main effects but also 2-factor interactions are expected to be 
active. Note that interactions between more than two factors are usually considered negligible. 
This is usually appropriate, if the experimental region is not too large, since many 
functions can be approximated well by first- or second-order polynomials over small regions. 
</p>
<p>Regular (Fractional) Factorial designs can be run in blocks. This is advisable, whenever the experimental 
units are not homogeneous, but smaller groups of units (the blocks) can be made 
reasonably homogeneous (e.g., batches of material, etc.). The number of blocks 
must be a power of 2. If there are some experimental factors, that can only be varied for 
a complete block, a so-called splitplot design is needed; this can be accomodated 
by function <code><a href="FrF2.html#topic+FrF2">FrF2</a></code>, but has not been implemented in this GUI so far.
</p>
<p>If package <span class="pkg"><a href="FrF2.catlg128.html#topic+FrF2.catlg128-package">FrF2.catlg128</a></span> 
is installed (this will not be necessary for standard use), 
there is an Expert menu entry for loading catalogues from this package 
for usage with regular fractional factorial 2-level designs. 
On using this menu entry, the package is loaded, and a list of catalogues is shown. 
Do not unnecessarily load them, because some of them are very large.
</p>


<h3>Warning</h3>

<p>Important: For both types of design, like also for other factorial designs, 
the experiment must conduct all experimental runs as determined in the design, 
because the design properties will deteriorate in ways not easily foreseeable, 
if some combinations are omitted. 
</p>
<p>It must be carefully considered in the planning phase, whether it is 
possible to conduct all experimental runs, or whether there might be restrictions 
that do not permit all combinations to be run (e.g.: three factors, each with levels 
&ldquo;small&rdquo; and &ldquo;large&rdquo;, where the combination with all three factors 
at level &ldquo;large&rdquo; is not doable because of space restrictions). 
If such restrictions are encountered, the design should be devised in a different way from the beginning. 
If possible, reasonable adjustments to levels should ensure that a factorial design 
becomes feasible again. Alternatively, a non-orthogonal D-optimal design can take 
the restrictions into account. <em>Unfortunately, this functionality is not yet implemented in this GUI.</em>

<h2 id='Menu.addresponse'>Adding (a) response(s) to an existing design</h2><span id='topic+Menu.addresponse'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This help file describes how to use the menu for adding (a) response(s).
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Select a design (default: active design) and decide, whether existing response 
data are to be replaced (useful e.g. if existing response contains missing values 
that are to be overwritten).
</p>
<p>Decide whether response data are already in R or are available from a <code>csv</code> file. 
In the latter case, changing the working directory is possible (but not necessary).
</p>
<p>If the response data are already in R or are to be calculated, fill in the appropriate 
information in the entry field for the response (for playing with random data, 
this could e.g. be <code>rnorm(8)</code>). Otherwise, select a csv file and choose the 
correct decimal setting. The chosen decimal setting will become the default also 
for other menus that require a decimal setting.
</p>
<p>Finally, provide a valid file name for the modified design.
</p>
<p>NOTE: If the response data are not in a csv file, they can be imported from all kinds 
of other file formats using from R commanders data management menu. The menu <em>Design</em> 
offers the sub menu <em>Modify Designs</em> with the <em>Add responses</em> menu item 
for this purpose.
</p>
<p>WARNING: Package <span class="pkg">RcmdrPlugin.DoE</span> has been subjected to some testing, but 
must still be considered a beta version. Especially for data handling routines like 
adding responses, importing csv files and the like, 
it is strongly recommended to <b>always keep a master copy of your valuable experimental 
data safely stored without touching it</b>. (This would even hold for a final version of 
the any software, but is of course far more important for a beta version.

<h2 id='Menu.Analyze'>Analyze experimental designs </h2><span id='topic+Menu.Analyze'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This is a brief explanation on the analysis facilities for experimental designs in the Analyze Design menu.</p>


<h3>Available analysis options</h3>

<p><b>Generally applicable analysis options</b>
The topmost menu entry Default linear model is of interest for all design types 
and is usable whenever the active dataset is a design with response. 
However, the default linear model analysis does not work for long version designs 
with repeated measurements or for parameter designs in long format, 
as it usually does not make sense in such situations. 
Rather, such designs should be brought into wide format by using the
Design &ndash;&gt; Combine or Modify Designs &ndash;&gt; Change from long to wide format
menu. 
</p>
<p>Note that the default linear model analysis is a quick 
first shot that should often be tuned and sometimes (e.g. in many cases splitplot designs) replaced 
by a different analysis strategy for serious modelling. Tuning can be 
done by using the built-in linear model functions from the R-Commander Analyze menu. 
The R-Commander Models menu also offers interesting options for subsequent 
model diagnostics and graphics.
</p>
<p><b>Analysis options for general factorial designs</b><br />
For a general factorial design with a response, main effects and interaction plots 
can be generated (one at a time) by a menu which was slightly from <span class="pkg">Rcmdr</span>s general 
menu for graphing arithmetic means.
</p>
<p><b>Analysis options specific to 2-level designs</b><br />
There are two types of orthogonal 2-level factorial designs, 
regular fractional factorial designs and screening designs. 
The latter has more interesting analysis options than the former.
</p>
<p>Effects plots and main effects plots are of interest for both types of 2-level 
designs alike, while interaction plots are usually of interest for the regular designs only.
</p>
<p>Note that the interpretation of all effects plots, main effects and interaction plots 
is useful only in connection with knowledge about the alias structure of a design. 
For regular designs, this can e.g. be obtained from the <em>Summarize design</em> 
menu item within the <em>Inspect design</em> sub menu of the <em>Design</em> menu. 
For screening designs, if it can be assumed that interactions are likely to be 
much less important than main effects, the main effect plots may be interpretable 
without such thoughts. Considerations involving the interactions become quite complicated 
with screening designs because of partial aliasing. 
Advanced users might also want to try the Bayesian methods 
offered in package <code><a href="BsMD.html#topic+BsMD-package">BsMD-package</a></code>, which are currently not implemented

<p><b>Analysis options specific to designs with quantitative factors</b><br />
are available within R-package <span class="pkg"><a href="rsm.html#topic+rsm-package">rsm</a></span> 
and are implemented in particular for response surface designs; they can also 
be used for other designs with quantitative variables, especially for latin hypercube 
designs. (However, for the latter, there are often reasons to use nonparametric approaches. 
</p>
<p>The menu item <em>Response surface model ...</em> creates a response surface 
analysis with first order (FO) terms, and potentially also two-factor interactions 
(TWI) and/or pure quadratic (PQ) terms. The resulting object has class <code><a href="rsm.html#topic+rsm">rsm</a></code> 
and can be postprocessed with the subsequent menu items.
</p>
<p>The menu item <em>Steepest slope ...</em> supports moving the experimental range 
towards a more promising area, based on a first order model or on a second order 
model with a saddle point.
</p>
<p>The menu item <em>Plot response surface ...</em> supports creation of contour, 
perspective or image plots of a response surface model, 
and can also be used for linear models with quantitative variables.
</p>
<p><b>General analysis functionality from R Commander </b><br />
It is of course also possible to use other analysis facilities within the R Commander, 
or to use the command-line facilities offered in package <code><a href="rsm.html#topic+rsm-package">rsm</a></code>
and elsewhere.

<h2 id='Menu.augmentlhs'>Menu for augmenting an existing latin hypercube sample</h2><span id='topic+Menu.augmentlhs'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>With this menu, an existing latin hypercube sample for quantitative factors 
can be augmented. The menu calls function lhs.augment from 
R-package DoE.wrapper.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>Menu.augmentlhs()
</code></pre>


<h3>Prior Remark for Windows users</h3>

<p>The most important technical point about this menu and the R-Commander in general: <br />
The R GUI should be installed with the Single Document Interface (SDI) mode 
instead of the default MDI mode. John Fox, the author of R-Commander, has described 
how to change MDI to SDI, if R has been installed in the wrong mode. 
It is strongly discouraged to run the R-Commander under the MDI mode, 
as it happens very frequently that windows suddenly disappear. They usually 
have iconized only and can be retrieved from the taskbar; nevertheless, this behavior 
can be very annoying and can be avoided by using R in SDI mode.</p>


<h3>User form structure</h3>

<p>This user form is structured as a notebook with several tabs, and each tab has its 
own specific help button. 
It is recommended to work through the tabs from left 
to right, although it is possible to switch between tabs back and forth. 
</p>
<p>The buttons to the right of the tabs store or load form settings (cf. next section) 
for the complete form with all tabs.
</p>


<h3>What happens when pressing OK?</h3>

<p>On OK, the menu will create an experimental design as an R data frame with 
the attributes (<code>desnum</code>, <code>run.order</code> and <code>design.info</code>). 
The list <code>design.info</code> contains, among other things, the element 
<code>creator</code>, which contains the stored form. <br />
</p>
<p>If requested on the Export tab, the R workspace with ONLY the experimental 
design will be saved at the specified location with the ending <code>rda</code>, 
and an Excel-readable html-file or a csv-file will be generated, depending 
on the users choice. Alternatively, it is possible to permanently store an 
R workspace with ONLY the design later using the menu entry 
&ldquo;Export design&rdquo; from the &ldquo;Design&rdquo; menu, 
or the full R workspace can be stored using the appropriate entry in the 
&ldquo;File&rdquo; menu of R commander.
The menu entry for loading the stored R workspace in a future session 
can be found under &ldquo;Data Management&rdquo;.
</p>


<h3>Storing and loading form settings</h3>

<p>The settings of the form (all tabs) can be saved at any time with the 
button &ldquo;Store form&rdquo;, which generates an object (of class <code>menu.design2pb</code>). 
The button &ldquo;Load form&rdquo; can be used for loading these settings 
into the form again in order to continue working on the entries. 
The purpose of this functionality: work can be safely interrupted, 
or a finished design can be modified after a team discussion or ... 
</p>
<p>The stored inputs will be an object within the R session. 
If they are to be kept for future R sessions, the R workspace must be stored 
on disk or on another storage medium (file type <code>RData</code> or <code>rda</code>). 
This can be done from the file menu of the R commander (usually the leftmost menu). 
The menu entry for loading the stored R workspace in a future session 
can be found under &ldquo;Data Management&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>Within an R session, the latest stored form inputs are normally loaded automatically 
on next usage of the menu. If you want to restart fresh, 
the button &ldquo;Reset form&rdquo; sets everything to default again.
</p>
<p>As pointed out above, if a design is actually generated by pressing the OK button, 
the menu settings are saved within the design object. The button &ldquo;Load form&rdquo; 
knows how to load the form settings from designs, so that it is not necessary to 
separately store the form settings in this case.

<h3>Help on using the menu for changing contrasts</h3>

<p>This menu allows to change contrasts for one or more factors.
Contrary to R-Commanders native contrast changing function, 
it simultaneously treats the matrix <code>desnum</code> for the <code>design</code> object, 
so that the integrity of the class <code><a href="DoE.base.html#topic+class-design">design</a></code> 
object is maintained. 
Furthermore, it uses the contrast functions from base R rather than 
those from package <span class="pkg">car</span>.
</p>
<p>One or more factors can be selected from the list on the left and 
moved to the list on the right. On OK, all factors from the RHS list 
are assigned the chosen contrast.
</p>
<p>Note that the default contrast setting is &ldquo;Treatment (dummy) coding&rdquo;, 
regardless of the current factor coding.

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Contour plots for linear models with quantitative regressors</p>


<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>This dialog allows to specify pairs of numeric regressors for which the 
response surface is to be displayed. Each display can be a contour plot 
with or without image colours, a 3D-perspective plot or an image plot.
</p>
<p>For looking at several plots simultaneously, numbers of rows and columns 
can be specified. On OK, all plots are generated. One should always choose 
the number of rows and columns such that all requested plots fit on one display, 
otherwise the early plots will be overwritten by the later plots.
</p>
<p>The functions behind the functionality are <code><a href="rsm.html#topic+contour.lm">contour</a></code>, 
<code>persp</code> and <code>image</code>. 
</p>
<p>The second tab on the dialogue allows to specify at which values variables not 
in the plot are to be fixed. The default is the average for numeric variables, 
the first level for factors. (
</p>


<h3>Inputs</h3>


<dl>
<dt>number of rows and number of columns</dt><dd>
<p>These are used in the <code>mfrow</code> function for creating the 
row and column layout for arranging several plots.<br />
Within an R session, modifications are retained for further 
calls of the dialog.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Select plot type </dt><dd><p>Contour plots show contours of constant height, 
3D perspective plots show the surface in mesh form; both come with or 
without coloring. The image plots 
show colours only, without contours. It is mainly 
a matter of taste which plots to use.<br />
Within an R session, modifications are retained for further 
calls of the dialog.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Select pairs for plotting </dt><dd>
<p>The default choice plots pairs for all numeric factors. 
This can be too many plots for one page in case of many factors. <br />
For the top radio button, pairs can be conveniently formed from two groups 
of variables: <br />
1: each pair within group 1<br />
2: each pair within both groups 1 and 2 (but not pairs <em>between</em> groups)<br />
3: each pair that involves any factor from group 1<br />
4. each pair between groups 1 and 2 (but no pair <em>within</em> any group)<br />
Initially, all variables are in group 1. They can be moved between groups 
by selecting them with the mouse and moving them with the arrow buttons.
</p>
<p>In case of the bottom (manual selection) radio button choice, 
move selected 2-factor pairs between 
the available list (those are not selected) and the selected list by 
selecting them with the mouse (multiple selections possible) and 
moving them with the arrow buttons.<br />
These choices have to be redone with each call to the dialog.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Modify slice positions </dt><dd>
<p>Each response surface varies the values of two numeric variables, 
keeping all other variables fixed. These fixed values are also called the 
slice positions. The default slice positions are the average for numeric variables
and the first level for factors. These can be modified on the second tab of 
this dialog. Within an R session, modifications are retained for further 
calls of the dialog w.r.t the same model.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This help file describes displaying the active design in actual or standard 
run order.
</p>
<p>Displaying in actual run order is the default. It is useful for feasibility 
considerations, for   identifying unwanted systematic patterns, 
or for identifying run order effects in the responses.
</p>
<p>Displaying in standard run order is useful, because it helps to identify structure 
for some types of design (mainly for factorial designs, not so exciting e.g. for 
latin hypercube designs).

<p>With this menu, D-optimal designs 
can be generated. The menu calls function Dopt.design from 
R-package DoE.wrapper. Optionally, the candidate designs menu 
can be called before calling this menu in order to create 
a candidate design.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>Menu.cand()
Menu.Dopt()
</code></pre>


<h3>Prior Remark for Windows users</h3>

<p>The most important technical point about this menu and the R-Commander in general: <br />
The R GUI should be installed with the Single Document Interface (SDI) mode 
instead of the default MDI mode. John Fox, the author of R-Commander, has described 
how to change MDI to SDI, if R has been installed in the wrong mode. 
It is strongly discouraged to run the R-Commander under the MDI mode, 
as it happens very frequently that windows suddenly disappear. They usually 
have iconized only and can be retrieved from the taskbar; nevertheless, this behavior 
can be very annoying and can be avoided by using R in SDI mode.</p>


<h3>User form structure</h3>

<p>This user form is structured as a notebook with several tabs, and each tab has its 
own specific help button. 
It is recommended to work through the tabs from left 
to right, although it is possible to switch between tabs back and forth. 
</p>
<p>The buttons to the right of the tabs store or load form settings (cf. next section) 
for the complete form with all tabs.
</p>


<h3>What happens when pressing OK?</h3>

<p>On OK, the menu will create an experimental design as an R data frame with 
the attributes (<code>desnum</code>, <code>run.order</code> and <code>design.info</code>). 
The list <code>design.info</code> contains, among other things, the element 
<code>creator</code>, which contains the stored form. <br />
</p>
<p>If requested on the Export tab, the R workspace with ONLY the experimental 
design will be saved at the specified location with the ending <code>rda</code>, 
and an Excel-readable html-file or a csv-file will be generated, depending 
on the users choice. Alternatively, it is possible to permanently store an 
R workspace with ONLY the design later using the menu entry 
&ldquo;Export design&rdquo; from the &ldquo;Design&rdquo; menu, 
or the full R workspace can be stored using the appropriate entry in the 
&ldquo;File&rdquo; menu of R commander.
The menu entry for loading the stored R workspace in a future session 
can be found under &ldquo;Data Management&rdquo;.
</p>


<h3>Storing and loading form settings</h3>

<p>The settings of the form (all tabs) can be saved at any time with the 
button &ldquo;Store form&rdquo;, which generates an object (of class <code>menu.design2pb</code>). 
The button &ldquo;Load form&rdquo; can be used for loading these settings 
into the form again in order to continue working on the entries. 
The purpose of this functionality: work can be safely interrupted, 
or a finished design can be modified after a team discussion or ... 
</p>
<p>The stored inputs will be an object within the R session. 
If they are to be kept for future R sessions, the R workspace must be stored 
on disk or on another storage medium (file type <code>RData</code> or <code>rda</code>). 
This can be done from the file menu of the R commander (usually the leftmost menu). 
The menu entry for loading the stored R workspace in a future session 
can be found under &ldquo;Data Management&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>Within an R session, the latest stored form inputs are normally loaded automatically 
on next usage of the menu. If you want to restart fresh, 
the button &ldquo;Reset form&rdquo; sets everything to default again.
</p>
<p>As pointed out above, if a design is actually generated by pressing the OK button, 
the menu settings are saved within the design object. The button &ldquo;Load form&rdquo; 
knows how to load the form settings from designs, so that it is not necessary to 
separately store the form settings in this case.

<h2 id='Menu.ExpImp'>Exporting and importing Designs</h2><span id='topic+Menu.ExpImp'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This help file describes facilities for exporting and importing designs.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The <em>Import</em> sub menu of the <em>Design</em> menu allows to 
change the working directory, as a general convenience feature. 
Furthermore, it enables importing an R workspace 
with more than one object in it - this facility makes the first class <code>design</code> 
object in the work space the active data set, and it allows to import 
a design from the R workspace into R-Commander (=make it the active data set). 
Furthermore, a previously-exported design can be imported again, 
using both an edited <code>csv</code>-file 
(created from a stored <code>html</code>- or <code>csv</code>-file) and an <code>rda</code>-file. 
It is assumed that the <code>csv</code> file contains new responses, while the 
<code>rda</code>-file contains all the structural information on the design. (If the 
csv file contains responses ONLY, these must be in the correct order. If run order 
information is also contained in the csv file in the correct format, 
the rows of the file are correctly assigned to the rows of the design, even if 
reordered.)
</p>
<p>The <em>Export</em> menu allows to save a complete R workspace or to export an individual 
experimental design. Furthermore, it also allows to save the 
generated code scripts (script window) and output (output window). 
Exporting an individual experimental design to csv and/or html is often useful, 
as experimental data are usually more easily entered 
using software like Excel. If the files are handled in a controlled way, 
response data that are entered 
as additional columns to an exported <code>csv</code>- or <code>html</code>-file can be 
re-imported later, using the re-import dialog accessible from the import menu. 
For more detail, 
cf. <code><a href="DoE.base.html#topic+export.design">export.design</a></code> for the exporting and 
<code><a href="DoE.base.html#topic+add.response">add.response</a></code> for the re-importing based on a 
<code>csv</code>-file and an <code>rda</code>-file.
</p>
<p>Other features are not linked from the Design menu: 
If an experimental design is available in R format (e.g. by exporting it to rda, 
as mentioned in the previous paragraph) 
but responses are stored in a format different from <code>csv</code>, it is 
also possible to re-import the response data into the design. If the design without 
responses is the active design (e.g. after loading the <code>rda</code> file using 
the <em>Load R workspace</em> menu item from the <em>Import</em> sub menu of the <em>Design</em> menu), 
the response data can be imported using the appropriate menu item of the 
<em>Import data</em> sub menu of the <em>Data management</em> menu. Subsequently, 
the response data can be added to the design using the <em>Add response variable(s)...</em> 
item of the <em>Modify design ...</em> sub menu of the <code>Design</code> menu.
</p>
<p>It is also possible of course to import experimental data generated elsewhere 
that do not contain the structural information available with 
class <code><a href="DoE.base.html#topic+class-design">design</a></code> by using the usual import 
facilities from the <em>Data management</em> menu of R-Commander. 
However, for such experimental data, 
the usability of special features of package <span class="pkg">RcmdrPlugin.DoE</span> 
is severely restricted.

<h2 id='Menu.exportTab'>Using the export menu</h2><span id='topic+Menu.exportTab'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This help file describes the design exporting options.
Default choices are no exporting for design generation forms or 
exporting an html file and an rda file, when separately calling the export 
routine. 
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>


<dl>
<dt>design information</dt><dd><p> At the top of the form, the design name is shown 
(provided on the first tab of the design generation form) 
or can be chosen from the designs available in the R work space. </p>
</dd>
<dt>(How to) export radio buttons</dt><dd><p> determine the type(s) of export file(s). 
Choices are that <br />
no export file is generated (export tabs on design generation menus),<br />
OR all file types listed below are generated,<br /> 
OR only an <code>rda</code> file is generated,<br />
OR an <code>rda</code> file and an <code>html</code> file are generated, <br />
OR an <code>rda</code> file and a <code>csv</code> file are generated.<br />
If Microsoft Excel is to be used in providing the actual experimenters 
with an annotated file for experimentation, usage of an <code>html</code> 
file is recommended. After the experiment has been carried out, the data 
can be stored as <code>csv</code> and reimported into R, where they can be processed 
using the structural information from the design, if the stored <code>rda</code> file 
is also provided. </p>
</dd>
<dt>decimal separator radio buttons</dt><dd><p>determine the decimal separator to be used;
relevant, if the data contain decimal numbers; the default uses the <code>OutDec</code> 
option of the R system, the other choices explicity determine the decimal separator. 
If chosen correctly, the html file can be opened in Excel with decimal numbers 
read as such; furthermore, decimal separator &ldquo;,&rdquo; is taken to also mean 
separator &ldquo;;&rdquo;, i.e. <code>csv</code> files also use the matching separator 
(decimal separator comma goes with separator semicolon and corresponds to <code>read.csv2</code>, 
decimal separator point goes with separator comma and corresponds to <code>read.csv</code>). </p>
</dd>
<dt>The Storage Directory</dt><dd><p>can be changed with the selection button. 
For the separate export menu, the chosen directory will become the new working directory; 
this is not the case for the Export tab in design creation menus.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Provide the file name</dt><dd><p>without ending in the file names field. 
Files with this name and the appropriate endings are produced, 
as chosen by the &ldquo;(How to) export&rdquo; radio buttons.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>The replace checkbox</dt><dd><p>can be checked, if you want to replace previously 
created files. In this context, note that the rda file exports an R workspace 
that ONLY includes the generated design and NOT the complete R workspace content. <br />
If you want to store the complete R workspace, use the appropriate menu item 
on the R commander file menu (usually the left-most menu).</p>
</dd>
</dl>



<h3>Note</h3>

<p>The purpose of exporting to <code>html</code> or <code>csv</code> format is the possibility 
to edit response data outside of R, e.g. for persons without access to R who 
conduct the experiment. 
</p>
<p>The resulting edited data file can be stored in 
<code>csv</code> format and re-imported into R. If re-importing is done with the 
appropriate menu item in the <em>Import</em> sub menu of the <em>Design</em> menu, 
providing the stored <code>rda</code> file along with the edited data file, 
all structural information stored with the design is available. 
</p>
<p>If users prefer to store the edited data file in a format different from 
<code>csv</code>, the data can be re-imported in two steps: First, the 
edited data file must be imported with R-Commanders <em>Data management</em> 
menu. Afterwards, the response information can be added to the design using the 
menu item <em>Add response variable(s) ...</em> from the sub menu <em>Modify design</em> 
of the menu <code>Design</code>.

<h2 id='Menu.fac'>Menu for generating full factorial designs</h2><span id='topic+Menu.fac'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This menu is for generating full factorial designs. 
The menu calls function function fac.design from package DoE.base 
and has been opened internally using the function shown in the usage section, 
which normal users will never have to deal with.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>Menu.fac()
</code></pre>


<h3>Prior Remark for Windows users</h3>

<p>The most important technical point about this menu and the R-Commander in general: <br />
The R GUI should be installed with the Single Document Interface (SDI) mode 
instead of the default MDI mode. John Fox, the author of R-Commander, has described 
how to change MDI to SDI, if R has been installed in the wrong mode. 
It is strongly discouraged to run the R-Commander under the MDI mode, 
as it happens very frequently that windows suddenly disappear. They usually 
have iconized only and can be retrieved from the taskbar; nevertheless, this behavior 
can be very annoying and can be avoided by using R in SDI mode.</p>


<h3>User form structure</h3>

<p>This user form is structured as a notebook with several tabs, and each tab has its 
own specific help button. 
It is recommended to work through the tabs from left 
to right, although it is possible to switch between tabs back and forth. 
</p>
<p>The buttons to the right of the tabs store or load form settings (cf. next section) 
for the complete form with all tabs.
</p>


<h3>What happens when pressing OK?</h3>

<p>On OK, the menu will create an experimental design as an R data frame with 
some attributes (<code>desnum</code>, <code>run.order</code> and <code>design.info</code>). 
The list <code>design.info</code> contains, among other things, the element 
<code>creator</code>, which contains the stored form. <br />
</p>
<p>If requested on the Export tab, the R workspace with ONLY the experimental 
design will be saved at the specified location with the ending <code>rda</code>, 
and an Excel-readable html-file or a csv-file will be generated, depending 
on the users choice. Alternatively, it is possible to permanently store an 
R workspace with ONLY the design later using the menu entry 
&ldquo;Export design&rdquo; from the &ldquo;Design&rdquo; menu, 
or the full R workspace can be stored using the appropriate entry in the 
&ldquo;File&rdquo; menu of R commander.
The menu entry for loading the stored R workspace in a future session 
can be found under &ldquo;Data Management&rdquo;.
</p>


<h3>Storing and loading form settings</h3>

<p>The settings of the form (all tabs) can be saved at any time with the 
button &ldquo;Store form&rdquo;, which generates an object (of class <code>menu.design2pb</code>). 
The button &ldquo;Load form&rdquo; can be used for loading these settings 
into the form again in order to continue working on the entries. 
The purpose of this functionality: work can be safely interrupted, 
or a finished design can be modified after a team discussion or ... 
</p>
<p>The stored inputs will be an object within the R session. 
If they are to be kept for future R sessions, the R workspace must be stored 
on disk or on another storage medium (file type <code>RData</code> or <code>rda</code>). 
This can be done from the file menu of the R commander (usually the leftmost menu). 
The menu entry for loading the stored R workspace in a future session 
can be found under &ldquo;Data Management&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>Within an R session, the latest stored form inputs are normally loaded automatically 
on next usage of the menu. If you want to restart fresh, 
the button &ldquo;Reset form&rdquo; sets everything to default again.
</p>
<p>As pointed out above, if a design is actually generated by pressing the OK button, 
the menu settings are saved within the design object. The button &ldquo;Load form&rdquo; 
knows how to load the form settings from designs, so that it is not necessary to 
separately store the form settings in this case.

If this box is checked, the factor details include an additional column 
for the column numbers that needs to be filled with a valid column number for 
each factor. The number of levels is then automatically derived. 
</p>
<p>Specifying column numbers can be useful, if an expert user has investigated the 
properties of a design and wants to obtain a better-suited design than the 
default one. For example, when accomodating two 2-level factors, one 4-level factor 
and one 8-level factor in <code>L64.2.5.4.10.8.4</code>, it is better to use columns 2 and 3 
than the default columns 1 and 2 for the two 2-level factors. With the latest 
version of the software, this optimization can also be done automatically using 
the setting &ldquo;min3&rdquo; for Automatic Optimization on the &ldquo;Base Settings&rdquo; tab;
nevertheless, because of performance reasons, it may be wise to specify known good column 
numbers, if available. 
Note that explicit specification of column numbers overrides any optimization request.

<h2 id='Menu.facTab1'>Basic information for full factorial designs</h2><span id='topic+Menu.facTab1'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This help file describes usage of the basic information tab of 
the full factorial design menu</p>


<h3>Brief statistical background</h3>

<p>Full factorial designs consist of all possible combinations of factor levels, 
i.e. the number of runs is the product of all numbers of factor levels, 
for example 24 for an experiment with two 2-level factors and one 6-level 
factor. Of course, their size grows fast with the number of factors. If 
a full factorial design is not feasible, orthogonal main effects designs 
or (manually-generated) combinations of smaller designs may be a reasonable 
option.</p>


<h3>Inputs on Tab Base Settings</h3>


<dl>
<dt>name of design</dt><dd><p>must be a valid name. The design itself is created under 
this name in the R workspace. </p>
</dd>
<dt>number of runs</dt><dd><p>is a consequence of the specifications on the Factor Details tab.
It is displayed for information purposes only; its value is only valid if 
the Factor Details tab contains entries for all factors.</p>
</dd>
<dt>number of factors</dt><dd><p>must always be specified. 
The number of factors must match the number of entries on the Factor Details tab.</p>
</dd>
<dt>replications</dt><dd><p>is the number of times each experimental run is conducted. 
If larger than 1, each run is conducted several times. If the checkbox next 
to the number of replications is checked, it is assumed that the experiment 
involves repeated measurements for one setup of the experimental run; if it 
is not checked, the experimental run itself is replicated with everything 
relevant newly set up (much more valuable than repeated measurements, unless 
the key driver of variability is in the measuring step). If the check box is 
not checked, the experiment will be randomized separately for each round of 
replications (first all first runs, then all second runs etc.).</p>
</dd>
<dt>number of blocks</dt><dd><p>is the number of equally-sized blocks of homogeneous 
units into which the overall number of runs is to be subdivided. 
Note that the number of blocks must be compatible with the numbers of 
levels of the experiment: it must be the product of one or more primes 
that the numbers of levels factor into. For example, <br />
a design with three factors at 2,5 and 5 levels can have 
5 blocks or 10 units each, no other blocking is possible for this design 
because it would confound blocks with factor main effects;<br />
a design with three factors at 2, 6 and 6 levels can have 2, 3, 6, 4 or 12 blocks, 
because all these numbers of blocks can be obtained from the three 2s and two 3s 
the numbers of levels factor into without confounding a main effect.<br />
An error message will be given whenever an impossible number of 
blocks or a number of blocks that would require aliasing of blocks with 
main effects is used; the design is generated with a warning message 
whenever the block factor is aliased 
with any two-factor interaction among the design factors. </p>
</dd>
<dt>randomization settings</dt><dd><p>should normally not be changed; you can provide a 
seed if you want to exactly reproduce a randomized design created in the past.
Unchecking the randomization box will produce a non-randomized experiment. 
This is usually NOT recommended.</p>

<h2 id='Menu.FrF2level'>Menu for generating regular fractional factorial 2-level designs</h2><span id='topic+Menu.FrF2level'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>With this menu, regular fractional factorial 2-level designs 
can be generated. The menu calls function FrF2 from package FrF2 
and has been opened internally using the function shown in the usage section, 
which normal users will never have to deal with.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>Menu.FrF2level()
</code></pre>


<h3>Prior Remark for Windows users</h3>

<p>The most important technical point about this menu and the R-Commander in general: <br />
The R GUI should be installed with the Single Document Interface (SDI) mode 
instead of the default MDI mode. John Fox, the author of R-Commander, has described 
how to change MDI to SDI, if R has been installed in the wrong mode 
(<a href="https://www.john-fox.ca/RCommander/installation-notes.html">https://www.john-fox.ca/RCommander/installation-notes.html</a>). 
It is strongly discouraged to run the R-Commander under the MDI mode, 
as it happens very frequently that windows suddenly disappear. They usually 
have iconized only and can be retrieved from the taskbar; nevertheless, this behavior 
can be very annoying and can be avoided by using R in SDI mode.</p>


<h3>User form structure</h3>

<p>This user form is structured as a notebook with several tabs, and each tab has its 
own specific help button. 
It is recommended to work through the tabs from left 
to right, although it is possible to switch between tabs back and forth. 
</p>
<p>If the checkbox &ldquo;Activate Special Choices&rdquo; is ticked, the user form gets additional 
tabs for requesting estimable 2-factor interactions, for block or split-plot details, 
and for hard-to-change factors. 
Also, some of the standard tabs get more content than otherwise. 
If you are not an expert in the statistical details of experimental design, it is 
normally best to not activate these additional choices. The standard choices 
are sufficient for many purposes.
</p>
<p>The buttons to the right of the tabs store or load form settings (cf. next section) 
for the complete form with all tabs.
</p>


<h3>What happens when pressing OK?</h3>

<p>On OK, the menu will create an experimental design as an R data frame with 
some attributes (<code>desnum</code>, <code>run.order</code> and <code>design.info</code>). 
The list <code>design.info</code> contains, among other things, the element 
<code>creator</code>, which contains the stored form. <br />
</p>
<p>If requested on the Export tab, the R workspace with ONLY the experimental 
design will be saved at the specified location with the ending <code>rda</code>, 
and an Excel-readable html-file or a csv-file will be generated, depending 
on the users choice. Alternatively, it is possible to permanently store an 
R workspace with ONLY the design later using the menu entry 
&ldquo;Export design&rdquo; from the &ldquo;Design&rdquo; menu, 
or the full R workspace can be stored using the appropriate entry in the 
&ldquo;File&rdquo; menu of R commander.
The menu entry for loading the stored R workspace in a future session 
can be found under &ldquo;Data Management&rdquo;.
</p>


<h3>Storing and loading form settings</h3>

<p>The settings of the form (all tabs) can be saved at any time with the 
button &ldquo;Store form&rdquo;, which generates an object (of class <code>menu.design2FrF</code>). 
The button &ldquo;Load form&rdquo; can be used for loading these settings 
into the form again in order to continue working on the entries. 
The purpose of this functionality: work can be safely interrupted, 
or a finished design can be modified after a team discussion or ... 
</p>
<p>The stored inputs will be an object within the R session. 
If they are to be kept for future R sessions, the R workspace must be stored 
on disk or on another storage medium (file type <code>RData</code> or <code>rda</code>). 
This can be done from the file menu of the R commander (usually the leftmost menu). 
The menu entry for loading the stored R workspace in a future session 
can be found under &ldquo;Data Management&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>Within an R session, the latest stored form inputs are normally loaded automatically 
on next usage of the menu. If you want to restart fresh, 
the button &ldquo;Reset form&rdquo; sets everything to default again.
</p>
<p>As pointed out above, if a design is actually generated by pressing the OK button, 
the menu settings are saved within the design object. The button &ldquo;Load form&rdquo; 
knows how to load the form settings from designs, so that it is not necessary to 
separately store the form settings in this case.

</dd>
<dt>replications</dt><dd><p>is the number of times each experimental run is conducted. 
If larger than 1, each run is conducted several times. If the checkbox next 
to the number of replications is checked, it is assumed that the experiment 
involves repeated measurements for one setup of the experimental run; if it 
is not checked, the experimental run itself is replicated with everything 
relevant newly set up (much more valuable than repeated measurements, unless 
the key driver of variability is in the measuring step). If the check box is 
not checked, the experiment will be randomized separately for each round of 
replications (first all first runs, then all second runs etc.).</p>
</dd>
<dt>blocks</dt><dd><p>is the number of blocks. Blocks are needed, if a factor relevant to 
the outcome but not of interest in itself is to be corrected for (e.g. batch 
of material). If you just give a number here, the program takes care of 
all details itself. If you are an expert and consider it necessary, 
you can provide more information on the 
special tab on blocking that is visible if special choices have been activated. </p>
</dd>
<dt>randomization settings</dt><dd><p>should normally not be changed; you can provide a

Unchecking the randomization box will produce a non-randomized experiment. 
This is usually NOT recommended.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Design Properties</dt><dd><p>allow to set a minimum resolution (III, IV or V+); 
for most purposes, IV is a good solution, i.e. it might be a good idea to

In addition, a choice can be made between <br />
MA = maximum resolution and minimum aberration, 
which implies usage of the design with the 
overall least severe degree of aliasing among effects, <br />
OR<br />
MaxC2 = maximum number of clear 2-factor interactions, which means that the 
design is chosen for which the most 2-factor interactions are not aliased with 
any other main effect or 2-factor interaction. 
</p>
<p>Note that, when choosing MaxC2, it is particularly important to also 
consider setting resolution to IV, as otherwise the design will very likely 
be of resolution III only, even if there are good resolution IV designs with 
many clear 2-factor interactions around.</p>

</p>
<p>Note that you may want to retrieve the still open menu from somewhere

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Estimable 2fis for regular (fractional) factorial 2-level designs</p>


<h3>Warnings</h3>

<p>Not all combinations of inputs are compatible with each other. You may avoid 
unnecessary work by reading the advice below. In case of violating the 
restrictions below, the specification of estimable 2fis will take precedence over 
other specifications (you will be warned, if this happens; on re-opening the dialog, 
you will then have the chance to adjust the settings).
</p>
<p>Blocked designs (number of blocks larger than 1 on the &ldquo;Base Settings&rdquo; tab) 
and specification of an estimable model are not compatible 
with each other in the current version of the software. 
Thus, you have to decide on using blocks OR specifying estimable 2-factor interactions. 
(Nevertheless, 2 or 4 blocks can be specified as detailed in the 
section &ldquo;Brief statistical background&rdquo; below. 
</p>
<p>Generators or a specific design (radio buttons on the &ldquo;Base Settings&rdquo; tab) 
can neither be specified together with estimable 2-factor interactions.
</p>
<p>Finally, it is neither possible to simultaneously specify 
hard-to-change factors on the &ldquo;Factor Details&rdquo; tab and 
estimable 2-factor interactions. 
</p>


<h3>Brief statistical background</h3>

<p>This tab allows to specify 2-factor interactions (2fis) that are of special 
interest and must be estimable from the experiment. Per default, it is assumed 
that the design must be at least of resolution IV.
</p>
<p>There are two different approaches to estimability: If it can realistically be assumed that 
all the 2fis that are not of special interest are negligible, it is sufficient 
to request that the specified 2fis are clear of aliasing with EACH OTHER. Otherwise, 
i.e. if one is not prepared to assume that all the unselected 2fis are negligible, 
it is more appropriate to request that the specified 2fis are clear of aliasing 
with ANY 2fis (both with each other and the other 2fis). Even under this approach, the 
design need not be resolution V, since the unselected 2fis may be aliased 
with each other. 
</p>
<p>If a design with certain interactions to be estimable is to be run in more 
than four blocks, there is currently no automated way to produce it, 
as it is not permitted to specify a number of blocks together 
with selecting 2fis to be estimable. A blocked design with 2 or 4 blocks can be 
obtained by explicitly including one (2 blocks) or two (4 blocks) blocking factors. <br />
For the case of 4 blocks, it is important to include the interaction between 
the two blocking factors into the selected interactions. <br />
For the case of 2 blocks only, the blocking factor is treated like the 
other factors, i.e. if its interactions with other factors are not among the selected ones, 
they may be aliased with other 2fis (and even with main effects, 
if resolution III is permitted in exceptional situations), which is usually 
considered adequate. 
</p>
<p>The design is created with function <code><a href="FrF2.html#topic+FrF2">FrF2</a></code> from package <span class="pkg">FrF2</span>. 
The special functionality for estimable 2fis is described <code><a href="FrF2.html#topic+estimable.2fis">here</a></code>. 
Users who are not familiar with the terminology around regular fractional factorial designs (e.g. 
the concept of resolution) can browse the <code><a href="#topic+DoEGlossary">DoEGlossary</a></code>.
</p>


<h3>Inputs on Tab Estimable Model</h3>


<dl>
<dt>Mode of requesting estimable 2-factor interactions</dt><dd>
<p>The radio button switches off the request for specific interactions to 
be estimable or requests one of the two implemented modes that have 
been discussed above. </p>
</dd>
<dt>Mimimum resolution</dt><dd><p>is per default IV and can be set to III by checking 
the box. Usually, the default is more appropriate.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Select 2-factor interactions </dt><dd>
<p>In case of the manual selection radio button choice, 
move selected 2-factor interactions between 
the available list (those are not selected) and the selected list by 
selecting them with the mouse (multiple selections possible) and 
moving them with the arrow buttons.<br />
For some classical structures (compromise designs by Addelman (1962) or Ke, Tang and Wu (2005), 
cf. also <code><a href="FrF2.html#topic+estimable.2fis">estimable.2fis</a></code>), 
it is more comfortable, and in case of distinct designs 
(bottom radio button for mode of requesting estimable interactions) also often much faster, 
to use the pre-specified strucures for two groups of factors; the type of structure 
can be selected from the drop-down, and the factors can be moved between the two groups 
using the arrow buttons (each factor must belong to one of the groups). </p>
</dd>
<dt>Limit search time</dt><dd><p>If the bottom radio button for the mode of requesting estimable 2fis 
is chosen, the search for a 
design can take a long time. In this case, it is possible to increase (or decrease) 
the search time after which the search is stopped even if no appropriate design 
was identified. Searches with extensive requests can easily time out, 
especially if they are not implemented using the pre-specified group structure. 
Expert users may be able to utilize the structure of their problem for finding 
an appropriate design, using the command-line language rather than the menus. </p>

<h2 id='Menu.General'>General factorial designs</h2><span id='topic+Menu.General'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This menu covers full factorial designs orthogonal main effects designs 
for cases for which not all factors are at two levels. 
Furthermore, Taguchi-parameter designs are covered. This 
help file is about how and when to apply these.</p>


<h3>Quantitative or Qualitative</h3>

<p>Both types of design are suitable for quantitative and qualitative factors alike. 
If you have quantitative factors only, you may want to consider the special menu for these.
</p>


<h3>Full factorial designs</h3>

<p>Full factorial designs are straight-forward to generate and are generated by 
function <code><a href="DoE.base.html#topic+fac.design">fac.design</a></code> from package <span class="pkg">DoE.base</span>. The 
number of runs needed for a full factorial experiment is the product of the numbers 
of levels of all factors. This may be more than is feasible. In such situations, the 
orthogonal main effects plans may be helpful. If interactions are also of interest, 
it may be useful to combine several plans or to pay attention to specific properties of 
orthogonal arrays (automatic support for such possibilities is currently poor and will be improved 
in the future).<br /> 
Full factorial designs can be run in blocks. This is advisable, whenever the experimental 
units are not homogeneous, but smaller groups of units (the blocks) can be made 
reasonably homogeneous (e.g., batches of material, etc.). </p>


<h3>Orthogonal main effects plans</h3>

<p>If a full factorial experiment is too large, an orthogonal main effects plan may be useful. 
As long as there are no interactions between the factors represented by columns of the array, 
all such arrays work well, provided they are large enough for stable estimation. Some arrays also 
work well in the presence of interactions or even allow estimation of interactions for special subsets 
of variables. However, there is no automated support for selection of an array that 
has desirable properties. It may therefore be useful to specifically select an array 
the properties of which are known to the experimenter.</p>


<h3>Warning</h3>

<p>Important: For all factorial designs, 
the experiment must conduct all experimental runs as determined in the design, 
because the design properties will deteriorate in ways not easily foreseeable, 
if some combinations are omitted. 
</p>
<p>It must be carefully considered in the planning phase, whether it is 
possible to conduct all experimental runs, or whether there might be restrictions 
that do not permit all combinations to be run (e.g.: three factors, each with levels 
&ldquo;small&rdquo; and &ldquo;large&rdquo;, where the combination with all three factors 
at level &ldquo;large&rdquo; is not doable because of space restrictions). 
If such restrictions are encountered, the design should be devised in a different way from the beginning. 
If possible, reasonable adjustments to levels should ensure that a factorial design 
becomes feasible again. Alternatively, a non-orthogonal D-optimal design can take 
the restrictions into account. <em>Unfortunately, this functionality is not yet implemented in this GUI.</em>
</p>


<h3>Taguchi inner-outer array designs - also called parameter designs</h3>

<p>With the menu item <em>Create Taguchi inner-outer array</em>, two <b>existing</b> designs 
can be combined into a crossed inner-outer array design. For more detail, see the 
literature and the help in the Taguchi design menu.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Using the menu for 2-level main effects and interaction plots</p>


<h3>Using the menu for 2-level main effects and interaction plots</h3>

<p>Select the response that is to be analysed.<br />
Select the factors whose main effects or interactions are to be plotted 
(at least two factors are needed even for main effects).<br />
Decide with the radio buttons, whether a main effects plot or an interaction plot is needed.<br />
Select the abbreviation length for factor names from a list of lengths (Often the default will be OK).<br />
For interaction plots, indicate whether confounding should be shown in the plot. 
The default is to show confounding, if confounded interactions are present.
</p>


<h3>Interpreting the alias information in the interaction plots</h3>

<p>If alias information is shown, each plot has a number. 
Plots with identical numbers are based on the same effect estimate, i.e. 
they are confounded. This means that the displayed interaction is the sum 
of all the confounded interactions - they can either work into the same 
direction or into opposite directions, or most of them are negligible and 
one is dominating or ...

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This help file describes how to re-import an exported design 
that exists as an rda and a csv file, when using the R-Commander.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>A design has usually been exported in order to input the response data 
outside of R. This is also the recommended strategy. 
</p>
<p>The re-importing supports the addition of responses that are available in a csv file
to the class <code><a href="DoE.base.html#topic+class-design">design</a></code> data frame in the saved rda file.
Usage of this menu also works, if the design is already present in the R workspace. 
In this case, it is not necessary to first load an rda file. 
</p>
<p>Simply provide a valid file name for the combined design, <br />
for convenience, change the working directory,<br />
select the rda file, <br />
if necessary, select the correct design from the drop-down, <br />
select the csv file, <br />
adjust the decimal separator to the one used in the csv file, <br />
and press OK.
</p>
<p>NOTE: If the response data are not in a csv file, they can be imported from all kinds 
of other file formats using from R commanders data management menu. The menu <em>Design</em> 
offers the sub menu <em>Modify Designs</em> with the <em>Add responses</em> menu item 
for this purpose.

<h2 id='Menu.Inspect'>Inspecting the active design</h2><span id='topic+Menu.Inspect'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This help file describes the menu for inspecting the active design
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This menu offers possibilities for inspecting a designs properties. 
It is not meant to analyse data but to look at the structure of a design.
</p>
<p>The menu item <em>Display active design</em> prints the current design.<br />
The menu item <em>Summarize active design</em> prints a summary of the current design, 
based on the <code><a href="DoE.base.html#topic+summary.design">summary</a></code> method for 
class <code><a href="DoE.base.html#topic+class-design">design</a></code>.<br />
The menu item <em>Plot active design ...</em> plots selected experimental factors of the current design, 
based on the <code><a href="DoE.base.html#topic+plot.design">plot</a></code> method for 
class <code><a href="DoE.base.html#topic+class-design">design</a></code>, applied to the design stripped 
of any responses. <br />
The menu item <em>Tabulate active design ...</em> tabulates selected experimental factors 
of the current design.<br /> 
The menu item <em>Experts: display design.info for active design</em> displays the  
design.info attribute of the current design (cf. <code><a href="DoE.base.html#topic+class-design">design</a></code> 
for a general description of class <code>design</code> and its attributes).<br /> 
</p>
<p>Plotting and tabulating are particularly interesting for designs with qualitative factors, 
and when looking at three or four 
factors at a time, because this highlights factor combinations that do not occur 
or do not occur equally often. 
Ideally (generalized resolution IV), each projection onto three factors is a full factorial, 
which is equivalent to zero words of generalized length 3 (the analogous request 
for projections onto four factors corresponds to generalized resolution V).<br />
</p>
<p>Note that the menu items are available only, if the active data frame is a class 
<code><a href="DoE.base.html#topic+class-design">design</a></code> object.

<h3>Prior Remark for Windows users</h3>

<p>The most important technical point about this menu and the R-Commander in general: <br />
The R GUI should be installed with the Single Document Interface (SDI) mode 
instead of the default MDI mode. John Fox, the author of R-Commander, has described 
how to change MDI to SDI, if R has been installed in the wrong mode. 
It is strongly discouraged to run the R-Commander under the MDI mode, 
as it happens very frequently that windows suddenly disappear. They usually 
have iconized only and can be retrieved from the taskbar; nevertheless, this behavior 
can be very annoying and can be avoided by using R in SDI mode.</p>


<h3>User form structure</h3>

<p>This user form is structured as a notebook with several tabs, and each tab has its 
own specific help button. 
It is recommended to work through the tabs from left

</p>
<p>The buttons to the right of the tabs store or load form settings (cf. next section) 
for the complete form with all tabs.
</p>


<h3>What happens when pressing OK?</h3>

<p>On OK, the menu will create an experimental design as an R data frame with 
the attributes (<code>desnum</code>, <code>run.order</code> and <code>design.info</code>). 
The list <code>design.info</code> contains, among other things, the element 
<code>creator</code>, which contains the stored form. <br />

<p>If requested on the Export tab, the R workspace with ONLY the experimental 
design will be saved at the specified location with the ending <code>rda</code>, 
and an Excel-readable html-file or a csv-file will be generated, depending 
on the users choice. Alternatively, it is possible to permanently store an 
R workspace with ONLY the design later using the menu entry 
&ldquo;Export design&rdquo; from the &ldquo;Design&rdquo; menu, 
or the full R workspace can be stored using the appropriate entry in the 
&ldquo;File&rdquo; menu of R commander.
The menu entry for loading the stored R workspace in a future session 
can be found under &ldquo;Data Management&rdquo;.
</p>


<h3>Storing and loading form settings</h3>

<p>The settings of the form (all tabs) can be saved at any time with the 
button &ldquo;Store form&rdquo;, which generates an object (of class <code>menu.design2pb</code>). 
The button &ldquo;Load form&rdquo; can be used for loading these settings 
into the form again in order to continue working on the entries. 
The purpose of this functionality: work can be safely interrupted, 
or a finished design can be modified after a team discussion or ... 
</p>
<p>The stored inputs will be an object within the R session. 
If they are to be kept for future R sessions, the R workspace must be stored 
on disk or on another storage medium (file type <code>RData</code> or <code>rda</code>). 
This can be done from the file menu of the R commander (usually the leftmost menu). 
The menu entry for loading the stored R workspace in a future session 
can be found under &ldquo;Data Management&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>Within an R session, the latest stored form inputs are normally loaded automatically 
on next usage of the menu. If you want to restart fresh, 
the button &ldquo;Reset form&rdquo; sets everything to default again.
</p>
<p>As pointed out above, if a design is actually generated by pressing the OK button, 
the menu settings are saved within the design object. The button &ldquo;Load form&rdquo; 
knows how to load the form settings from designs, so that it is not necessary to 
separately store the form settings in this case.

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This dialog is used to specify a linear model to be fit by the <code><a href="stats.html#topic+lm">lm</a></code> function.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>Menu.linearModelDesign(response = NULL)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table role = "presentation">
<tr><td><code id="Menu.linearModelDesign_+3A_response">response</code></td>
<td>
<p> response to apply the linear model to</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The left model-formula box specifies the response variable to be used in the model; it
may be a variable name or an expression evaluating to the response variable, such as
<code>log(income)</code>.
</p>
<p>The right model-formula box specifies the right-hand (i.e., predictor) side of the model.
If you are interested in the details, see <code><a href="stats.html#topic+lm">lm</a></code>.
</p>
<p>You can type directly in the model formula boxes. Alternatively, double-clicking the left mouse
button on a variable in the variable-list transfers it to the left-hand side of the model (if
it is empty) or to the right-hand side. You can also enter operators and parentheses using the buttons
above the formula.
</p>
<p>For regular 2-level fractional factorial experiments, initially one often wants to look at all 
interactions up to a certain degree (e.g. 2 or 3). This is possible by selecting the degree of the 
model from the drop-down menu. For (half) normal plots of the effects, choose the degree high enough that 
there are <code>nruns-1</code> effects in the plot.
</p>
<p>If the active model is from this box or could have come from this box, 
the initial values of the left-hand-side and 
right-hand-side of the formula are retained from the previous model.

<h2 id='Menu.Modify'>Modifying designs </h2><span id='topic+Menu.Modify'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This help file describes the menu for modifying designs
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Freshly-generated designs do not have any responses. 
For very small designs, response values can be added by using the data editor 
within the <code>R-commander</code>. For larger designs, it is preferrable to do all editing 
outside of <code>R</code> and re-combine response data with the structural information 
using the <code>import</code> menu. It is also possible to add a response from a vector 
or data frame within <code>R</code> by using the menu item <em>Add response variable(s)</em>.
</p>
<p>Default analyses for experimental designs either work with all responses or with the first 
response of the design. It can therefore be advantageous to delete responses from the list of responses. 
This can be done with the menu item <em>Select/Deselect response variables</em>. 
At a later stage, one might want to 
redefine previous response variables as responses. This is also possible via that menu. 
</p>
<p>Contrary to response deselection, which leaves the variable in the design, 
one may want to permanently remove a column (response or other variable, but not 
experimental factor or block factor), for example 
because some artificial data for playing are no longer needed with real response data available. 
This can be done with the <em>Remove column(s)</em> menu item.
</p>
<p>Qualitative design factors come with prespecified contrast coding, which influences 
how analysis results appear. If the default contrasts are not the desired ones, they 
can be changed from the <em>Change contrasts</em> menu item. Note that this is preferrable 
to the built-in function from R-Commander, because it preserves the integrity 
of the class <code>design</code> object.
</p>
<p>Some designs come in long format (repeated measurements, some parameter designs) 
but should be brought into wide format and aggregated for conducting simple analyses. 
The reformatting can be done with the menu item <em>Change from long to wide format</em>, 
the subsequent aggregation with the menu item <em>Aggregate design</em>.
</p>
<p>The menu item <em>Fold design</em> (not yet implemented) will allow to augment 
a 2-level factorial designs with a second 
portion as large as the first one by reversing the levels of some or all factors. 
</p>
<p>The menu item <em>Add center points</em> allows to add center points to 2-level designs 
with only quantitative factors and certain further restrictions (e.g. no splitplot design). 
</p>
<p>The menu item <em>Add star portion for central composite design</em> allows to add 
a starpoints with center points to regular (fractional) factorial 2-level designs 
with only quantitative factors and certain further restrictions (e.g. no splitplot design, 
no estimability requirements). 
</p>
<p>The menu item <em>Augment lhs design</em> allows to add additional points to latin 
hypercube sample designs according to different types of augmentation rules 
available in R-package <span class="pkg"><a href="lhs.html#topic+lhs-package">lhs</a></span>.
</p>
<p>Note that command line use of the packages underlying this R-Commander routine is more 
flexible and allows more tuning.

<h2 id='Menu.oa'>Menu for generating orthogonal main effects designs</h2><span id='topic+Menu.oa'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This menu is for generating orthogonal arrays for experiments for which not all 
factors have 2 levels. The menu calls function function oa.design from package DoE.base 
and has been opened internally using the function shown in the usage section, 
which normal users will never have to deal with.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>Menu.oa()
</code></pre>


<h3>Prior Remark for Windows users</h3>

<p>The most important technical point about this menu and the R-Commander in general: <br />
The R GUI should be installed with the Single Document Interface (SDI) mode 
instead of the default MDI mode. John Fox, the author of R-Commander, has described 
how to change MDI to SDI, if R has been installed in the wrong mode. 
It is strongly discouraged to run the R-Commander under the MDI mode, 
as it happens very frequently that windows suddenly disappear. They usually 
have iconized only and can be retrieved from the taskbar; nevertheless, this behavior 
can be very annoying and can be avoided by using R in SDI mode.</p>


<h3>Why not 2-level factors only</h3>

<p>It is possible within this menu to handle situations with 2-level factors only. 
However, most of the time, treating experiments in 2-level factors with special 
functions for this purpose is both more convenient and yields more efficient designs. 
Thus, it is recommended to use the menu for 2-level designs, if all factors are at 
2 levels only. At the screening stage, where you are not yet sure which factors are 
important, it is very often reasonable to conduct the experiment with each factor 
at only 2 levels!
</p>
<p>Exceptions: special resolution V designs in 128, 256 or 2048 runs</p>


<h3>User form structure</h3>

<p>This user form is structured as a notebook with several tabs, and each tab has its 
own specific help button. 
It is recommended to work through the tabs from left 
to right, although it is possible to switch between tabs back and forth. 
</p>
<p>The buttons to the right of the tabs store or load form settings (cf. next section) 
for the complete form with all tabs.
</p>


<h3>What happens when pressing OK?</h3>

<p>On OK, the menu will create an experimental design as an R data frame with 
some attributes (<code>desnum</code>, <code>run.order</code> and <code>design.info</code>). 
The list <code>design.info</code> contains, among other things, the element 
<code>creator</code>, which contains the stored form. <br />
</p>
<p>If requested on the Export tab, the R workspace with ONLY the experimental 
design will be saved at the specified location with the ending <code>rda</code>, 
and an Excel-readable html-file or a csv-file will be generated, depending 
on the users choice. Alternatively, it is possible to permanently store an 
R workspace with ONLY the design later using the menu entry 
&ldquo;Export design&rdquo; from the &ldquo;Design&rdquo; menu, 
or the full R workspace can be stored using the appropriate entry in the 
&ldquo;File&rdquo; menu of R commander.
The menu entry for loading the stored R workspace in a future session 
can be found under &ldquo;Data Management&rdquo;.
</p>


<h3>Storing and loading form settings</h3>

<p>The settings of the form (all tabs) can be saved at any time with the 
button &ldquo;Store form&rdquo;, which generates an object (of class <code>menu.design2pb</code>). 
The button &ldquo;Load form&rdquo; can be used for loading these settings 
into the form again in order to continue working on the entries. 
The purpose of this functionality: work can be safely interrupted, 
or a finished design can be modified after a team discussion or ... 
</p>
<p>The stored inputs will be an object within the R session. 
If they are to be kept for future R sessions, the R workspace must be stored 
on disk or on another storage medium (file type <code>RData</code> or <code>rda</code>). 
This can be done from the file menu of the R commander (usually the leftmost menu). 
The menu entry for loading the stored R workspace in a future session 
can be found under &ldquo;Data Management&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>Within an R session, the latest stored form inputs are normally loaded automatically 
on next usage of the menu. If you want to restart fresh, 
the button &ldquo;Reset form&rdquo; sets everything to default again.
</p>
<p>As pointed out above, if a design is actually generated by pressing the OK button, 
the menu settings are saved within the design object. The button &ldquo;Load form&rdquo; 
knows how to load the form settings from designs, so that it is not necessary to 
separately store the form settings in this case.

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Basic information for orthogonal main effects design Menu</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>It is useful to look at available designs for deciding which specific design 
should be selected. For example, when trying to automatically optimize a design, it may be 
more useful to start from a design with relatively few factors. If a design for two 2-level 
factors, one 4-level factor and one 8-level factor is sought, you may e.g. use the array 
<code>L64.2.5.4.10.8.4</code> or the array <code>L64.2.53.4.1.8.1</code>, which will make quite 
a difference in terms of run time for the optimization choice &ldquo;min34&rdquo;. 
</p>
<p>The designs <code>L128.2.15.8.1</code>, <code>L256.2.19</code> and <code>L2048.2.63</code> are irregular resolution V 
designs for the 2-level factors.</p>


<h3>Brief statistical background</h3>

<p>The orthogonal main effects designs are of different types. 
They all work well if there are indeed no interactions between factors. 
Some of them have complete aliasing between main effects and two-factor interactions 
at least for some factors. It is therefore advisable to check the design 
before actually conducting the experiment with respect to its potential analysis 
options and biases. 
</p>
<p>Note that it is usually preferable to create 
an experiment with solely 2-level factors from the special menu for 2-level 
situations (exceptions: resolution V nonregular arrays in 128, 256 or 2048 runs, 
cf. Details section). 
If there is just one factor at more than 2 levels, it may also be 
useful to simply cross this factor with an otherwise 2-level design. <br />
</p>
<p>If only relatively few of the columns are used, 
it is possible with some orthogonal arrays to also estimate interactions, 
or at least to estimate main effects unbiasedly even in the presence of interactions. 
This may e.g. be possible for some of the arrays in 2, 4 and 8 or 16 level factors (that have 
arisen from regular fractional factorials). Automatic optimization can help finding such designs. 
</p>
<p>It is highly recommended to diagnose 
the structure of the design before using it for experimentation, e.g.  
using the &ldquo;Summarize design ...&rdquo; item in the &ldquo;Inspect design&rdquo; menu.
</p>


<h3>Inputs on Tab Base Settings</h3>


<dl>
<dt>name of design</dt><dd><p>must be a valid name. The design itself is created under 
this name in the R workspace. </p>
</dd>
<dt>number of factors</dt><dd><p>must always be specified. 
The number of factors must match the number of entries on the Factor Details tab.</p>
</dd>
<dt>specific array</dt><dd><p>can be selected from the drop-down list; this implies that this 
particular array is used for generating the design; the array name indicates its 
number of runs and the maximum possible numbers of factors with various numbers of levels. 
For example, the array <code>L12.2.2.6.1</code> can accomodate 2 factors at 2 levels each 
and one factor at 6 levels</p>
</dd>
<dt>Automatic optimization</dt><dd><p>can be selected from the drop-down list. 
The default is no optimization (&ldquo;none&rdquo;). &ldquo;min3&rdquo; requests 
minimization of generalized words of length 3 (cf. <code><a href="DoE.base.html#topic+generalized.word.length">generalized.word.length</a></code>), 
while &ldquo;min34&rdquo; requests further optimization among several equally-good 
length 3 designs w.r.t. length 4 words. Automatic optimization may sometimes take 
very long or use up too many resources; usability will be better 
for designs with fewer factors (cf. also details section). </p>
</dd>
<dt>minimum number of runs</dt><dd><p>can be selected from dropdown, but is not needed</p>
</dd>
<dt>minimum residual df</dt><dd><p>is per default 0 and can be set to any positive integer number; 
it specifies the minium number of extra runs over and above what would be needed for 
a model with main effects for all factors; for example, when using the design 
L12.2.2.6.1 for two 2-level factors and one 6-level factor, the model with all 
main effects requires <code>1+2*(2-1)+1*(6-1)=8</code> degrees of freedom, i.e. there are 
four extra degrees of freedom for pure error or lack of fit</p>
</dd>
<dt>replications</dt><dd><p>is the number of times each experimental run is conducted. 
If larger than 1, each run is conducted several times. If the checkbox next 
to the number of replications is checked, it is assumed that the experiment 
involves repeated measurements for one setup of the experimental run; if it 
is not checked, the experimental run itself is replicated with everything 
relevant newly set up (much more valuable than repeated measurements, unless 
the key driver of variability is in the measuring step). If the check box is 
not checked, the experiment will be randomized separately for each round of 
replications (first all first runs, then all second runs etc.).</p>
</dd>
<dt>randomization settings</dt><dd><p>should normally not be changed; you can provide a 
seed if you want to exactly reproduce a randomized design created in the past.
Unchecking the randomization box will produce a non-randomized experiment. 
This is usually NOT recommended.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Inspect available designs</dt><dd><p>based on requests on the number of runs (from, to) 
and decisions 
whether or not child <code><a href="DoE.base.html#topic+arrays">arrays</a></code> are to be shown, 
and whether to only display 
designs that can accomodate factors with the factor level 
settings from the &ldquo;Factor Details&rdquo; tab. The button will create 
a printout of the available designs, based on the work horse function 
<code><a href="DoE.base.html#topic+show.oas">show.oas</a></code>. The menu remains open and needs to be 
maximized again after looking at the displayed designs.</p>

<h2 id='Menu.Optimal'>Optimal designs</h2><span id='topic+Menu.Optimal'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Optimal designs start from the assumption that a certain 
model structure is suitable for the problem at hand and optimize 
the design points for estimation of this model structure.</p>


<h3>Optimal designs</h3>

<p>R package <span class="pkg">AlgDesign</span> offers optimal designs. 
This GUI currently offers the so-called D-optimal designs for standard situations only 
(no augmentation, no blocking, little tuning of parameters). 
D-optimal designs are most widely-spread but not necessarily best for all purposes. 
The implementation of D-optimal designs relies on a candidate data set.
</p>
<p>D-optimal designs are liked because they are very flexible in terms of run size. 
Furthermore, they are the only designs for which it is very easy to incorporate 
constraints. Whenever the specified run size offers enough degrees of freedom and 
the candidate set contains enough variety for estimating the model, 
a D-optimal design can be found. However, a design which is optimal for the chosen 
run size can be very bad in absolute terms; like always, miracles are not possible. 
</p>
<p>Furthermore, note that there are many situations in (industrial) experimentation, 
for which assuming a model structure is ambitious if not inadequate. For such situations, 
other types of designs should be used. 
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<p>As was already mentioned, the implementation of D-optimal designs in this GUI 
requires a candidate design, 
which can be any data frame, e.g. a full factorial design, an orthogonal array design 
or a latin hypercube design. The menu item <em>Candidate design ...</em> offers shortcuts 
for selection or creation of candidate designs. 
</p>
<p>The menu item <em>D-optimal design ...</em> allows creation of a D-optimal design, 
using the active data set (possibly restricted to exclude inadequate combinations) 
as the candidate set.

<h2 id='Menu.pb2level'>Menu for generating non-regular fractional factorial 2-level designs</h2><span id='topic+Menu.pb2level'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>With this menu, non-regular (=screening) orthogonal 2-level designs 
can be generated. The menu calls function function pb from package FrF2 
and has been opened internally using the function shown in the usage section, 
which normal users will never have to deal with.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>Menu.pb2level()
</code></pre>


<h3>Prior Remark for Windows users</h3>

<p>The most important technical point about this menu and the R-Commander in general: <br />
The R GUI should be installed with the Single Document Interface (SDI) mode 
instead of the default MDI mode. John Fox, the author of R-Commander, has described 
how to change MDI to SDI, if R has been installed in the wrong mode. 
It is strongly discouraged to run the R-Commander under the MDI mode, 
as it happens very frequently that windows suddenly disappear. They usually 
have iconized only and can be retrieved from the taskbar; nevertheless, this behavior 
can be very annoying and can be avoided by using R in SDI mode.</p>


<h3>User form structure</h3>

<p>This user form is structured as a notebook with several tabs, and each tab has its 
own specific help button. 
It is recommended to work through the tabs from left 
to right, although it is possible to switch between tabs back and forth. 
</p>
<p>The buttons to the right of the tabs store or load form settings (cf. next section) 
for the complete form with all tabs.
</p>


<h3>What happens when pressing OK?</h3>

<p>On OK, the menu will create an experimental design as an R data frame with 
some attributes (<code>desnum</code>, <code>run.order</code> and <code>design.info</code>). 
The list <code>design.info</code> contains, among other things, the element 
<code>creator</code>, which contains the stored form. <br />
</p>
<p>If requested on the Export tab, the R workspace with ONLY the experimental 
design will be saved at the specified location with the ending <code>rda</code>, 
and an Excel-readable html-file or a csv-file will be generated, depending 
on the users choice. Alternatively, it is possible to permanently store an 
R workspace with ONLY the design later using the menu entry 
&ldquo;Export design&rdquo; from the &ldquo;Design&rdquo; menu, 
or the full R workspace can be stored using the appropriate entry in the 
&ldquo;File&rdquo; menu of R commander.
The menu entry for loading the stored R workspace in a future session 
can be found under &ldquo;Data Management&rdquo;.
</p>


<h3>Storing and loading form settings</h3>

<p>The settings of the form (all tabs) can be saved at any time with the 
button &ldquo;Store form&rdquo;, which generates an object (of class <code>menu.design2pb</code>). 
The button &ldquo;Load form&rdquo; can be used for loading these settings 
into the form again in order to continue working on the entries. 
The purpose of this functionality: work can be safely interrupted, 
or a finished design can be modified after a team discussion or ... 
</p>
<p>The stored inputs will be an object within the R session. 
If they are to be kept for future R sessions, the R workspace must be stored 
on disk or on another storage medium (file type <code>RData</code> or <code>rda</code>). 
This can be done from the file menu of the R commander (usually the leftmost menu). 
The menu entry for loading the stored R workspace in a future session 
can be found under &ldquo;Data Management&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>Within an R session, the latest stored form inputs are normally loaded automatically 
on next usage of the menu. If you want to restart fresh, 
the button &ldquo;Reset form&rdquo; sets everything to default again.
</p>
<p>As pointed out above, if a design is actually generated by pressing the OK button, 
the menu settings are saved within the design object. The button &ldquo;Load form&rdquo; 
knows how to load the form settings from designs, so that it is not necessary to 
separately store the form settings in this case.

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Basic information for 2-level screening design Menu</p>


<h3>Brief statistical background</h3>

<p>Most of the screening designs are so-called Plackett-Burman designs. 
Exceptions occur, where Plackett and Burman did not suggest a design or where 
the Plackett-Burman designs coincide with the regular fractional factorial designs 
which are not so suitable for screening purposes. For more information, look at 
the help file for function <code><a href="FrF2.html#topic+pb">pb</a></code> from package <span class="pkg">FrF2</span>.
</p>


<h3>Inputs on Tab Base Settings</h3>


<dl>
<dt>name of design</dt><dd><p>must be a valid name. The design itself is created under 
this name in the R workspace. </p>
</dd>
<dt>number of runs</dt><dd><p>must be provided and must be a multiple of 4.</p>
</dd>
<dt>the check box</dt><dd><p>below the number of runs is relevant for 12 run designs only: 
if checked, the 12 run design is in the arrangement as provided by Taguchi, 
otherwise it is a Plackett-Burman design. (The two are equivalent to each 
other, but comparison is tedious.)</p>
</dd>
<dt>number of factors</dt><dd><p>must always be specified. It must be smaller than 
the number of runs. The function always creates a design with the number 
of factors one less than the number of runs. Those factors not used in the 
experiment are named e1, e2 etc. and serve for creating half-normal plots of 
the effects. 
The number of factors must match the number of entries on the Factor Details tab.</p>
</dd>
<dt>replications</dt><dd><p>is the number of times each experimental run is conducted. 
If larger than 1, each run is conducted several times. If the checkbox next 
to the number of replications is checked, it is assumed that the experiment 
involves repeated measurements for one setup of the experimental run; if it 
is not checked, the experimental run itself is replicated with everything 
relevant newly set up (much more valuable than repeated measurements, unless 
the key driver of variability is in the measuring step). If the check box is 
not checked, the experiment will be randomized separately for each round of 
replications (first all first runs, then all second runs etc.).</p>
</dd>
<dt>randomization settings</dt><dd><p>should normally not be changed; you can provide a 
seed if you want to exactly reproduce a randomized design created in the past.
Unchecking the randomization box will produce a non-randomized experiment. 
This is usually NOT recommended.</p>
</dd>

<h2 id='Menu.pickcube'>Pick the cube portion from a central composite design</h2><span id='topic+Menu.pickcube'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This help file describes how to use the menu for picking the cube portion from a central composite design.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Specify the name of the new cube only design (default: name of active design with 
<code>.cubeonly</code> appended), and press OK. The resulting reduced design can be used 
for effects plots of the cube portion etc. This is especially useful, if the star point 
response values are not yet available, and preliminary analyses are to be run.
</p>
<p>NOTE: If the intention is sequential experimentation (as is often the case), it is 
usually more desirable to first specify a standalone cube with center points and analyze 
that design, and to only append a star portion later, if needed. <br />
While subsequent reduction of a central composite design to its cube portion 
does work for many purposes, the resulting design is not as clean as a cube portion 
created from scratch; for example, augmenting it with a star portion again will fail. 
(This could of course be fixed, but this fix has low priority.)
</p>
<p>WARNING: Package <span class="pkg">RcmdrPlugin.DoE</span> has been subjected to some testing, but 
must still be considered a beta version. It is strongly recommended 
to <b>always keep a master copy of your valuable experimental 
data safely stored without touching it</b>. (This would even hold for a final version of 
any software, but is of course far more important for a beta version.

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This is a brief explanation on the menu for analysis of designs for quantitative factors.</p>


<h3>Available analysis options</h3>

<p>The menu item <em>Response surface model ...</em> creates a response surface 
analysis with first order (FO) terms, and potentially also two-factor interactions 
(TWI) and/or pure quadratic (PQ) terms. The resulting object has class <code><a href="rsm.html#topic+rsm">rsm</a></code> 
and can be postprocessed with the subsequent menu items.
</p>
<p>The menu item <em>Steepest slope ...</em> supports moving the experimental range 
towards a more promising area, based on a first order model or on a second order 
model with a saddle point.
</p>
<p>The menu item <em>Plot response surface ...</em> supports creation of contour, 
perspective or image plots of a response surface model, 
and can also be used for linear models with quantitative variables.
</p>
<p>It is of course also possible to use other analysis facilities within the R-commander, 
or to use the command-line facilities offered in package <code><a href="rsm.html#topic+rsm-package">rsm</a></code>
and elsewhere.

<h2 id='Menu.Quantitative'>Designs specifically tailored to quantitative factors</h2><span id='topic+Menu.Quantitative'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This GUI covers classical response surface designs (central composite 
and Box-Behnken) as well as so-called latin-hypercube samples for 
factors that can and should be set to many different levels. This 
help file is about when to apply which of these.</p>


<h3>Central composite designs</h3>

<p>Central composite designs can be generated from scratch or as an extension to 
2-level full or fractional factorials generated with the 2-level dialogue 
or with function <code>FrF2</code>. 
Their rationale is explained <code><a href="DoE.wrapper.html#topic+CentralCompositeDesigns">here</a></code>. 
They usually have five different levels per experimental factor.
</p>
<p>Box-Behnken designs have only three levels for each factor. They are explained 
<code><a href="DoE.wrapper.html#topic+bbd.design">here</a></code>. They can not be generated by augmenting 
an existing design.
</p>
<p>Latin hypercube designs - if used with optimization which is strongly recommended - 
try to fill the experimental space with points in an efficient way. Note that they are 
NOT trying to optimize the design w.r.t. a specific statistical model. 
Such optimal plans are available outside the R Commander with package <code>AlgDesign</code>. 
Simple versions of these have already been implemented into the R Commander.

<p> response to apply the response surface model to</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="Menu.rsm_+3A_factor.names">factor.names</code></td>
<td>
<p> character vector of factor names to apply the response surface model to</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The LHS model-formula box specifies the response variable to be used in the model; it
may be a variable name or an expression evaluating to the response variable, such as
<code>log(income)</code>.
</p>
<p>The RHS model-formula box specifies the right-hand (i.e., predictor) side of the model.
If you are interested in the details, see <code><a href="rsm.html#topic+rsm">rsm</a></code>. The formula 
consists of first order (FO), quadratic (PQ) and interaction (TWI) terms. Individual 
variables can be omitted from the formula or re-entered by editing the dialog. It is 
also possible but usually not necessary to enter extra variables. 
An existing blocking variable is per default included. <br />
If the analysis is coded, the variables must be given as <code>x1</code>, <code>x2</code>, and so forth, otherwise by 
their original names. <br />
For redoing from within this dialog, manually empty the RHS model-formula box; when clicking the FO, TWI, PQ and SO 
while some factors are selected in the variables box, the respective terms are entered to the model.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This help file describes usage of the steepest slope menu

The menu is only available 
if there is an rsm model available with at least one response.
</p>
<p>It is necessary to select the model (as rsm models cannot be 
active models in R Commander). The default degree is 2, but 
1 is also possible. 
</p>
<p>The checkbox provides a switch between classical steepest ascent 
in first order models (start in the middle) 
or models that are almost linear with far out optima (start in a saddle point). 
The latter option is reasonable for second order models, 
for which the Hessian reveals that there is 
still room for improvement = the stationary point is a nearby saddle point, 
it is more appropriate to try increasing (decreasing) the response starting 
at that saddle point and walking into both directions.

<h2 id='PlotMeansDoE.menu'>Menu for main effects and interaction plots for general factorial designs </h2><span id='topic+PlotMeansDoE.menu'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The menu for main effects and interaction plots for general factorial designs
allows to plot individual main effects plots (one factor selected) or interaction plots (two factors selected).</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The menu calls the <span class="pkg">RcmdrMisc</span> function <code>plotMeans</code> for creating simple
main effects or interaction plots for factorial designs. It is available whenever
the active data frame is an experimental design with at least one response that
has at least one factor (not a quantitative variable but a factor with categories).
</p>
<p>Arithmetic means for any numeric variable can be plotted separately for the levels of
one factor (main effects plot) or the level combinations of two factors (interaction plot).
An interaction plot created by the menu always makes the factor with fewer levels
the legend factor. (This can only be changed by modifying the command in command line
programming.)
</p>
<p>For designs with two-level factors only, the analogous menu for 2-level factors can do several plots
at once.
