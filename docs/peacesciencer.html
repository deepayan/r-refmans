<td>Description:</td>
<td>These are useful tools and data sets for the study of quantitative 
    peace science. The goal for this package is to include tools and data sets
    for doing original research that mimics well what a user would have to previously
    get from a software package that may not be well-sourced or well-supported.
    Those software bundles were useful the extent to which they encourage replications 
    of long-standing analyses by starting the data-generating process from scratch. However, 
    a lot of the functionality can be done relatively quickly and more transparently
    in the R programming language.</td>

<h2 id='add_archigos'>Add Archigos political leader information to dyad-year and state-year data</h2><span id='topic+add_archigos'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>add_archigos()</code> allows you to add some information about leaders to dyad-year
or state-year data. The function leans on an abbreviated version of the data, which also comes in this package.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>add_archigos(data)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr><td><code id="add_archigos_+3A_data">data</code></td>
<td>
<p>a dyad-year data frame (either &quot;directed&quot; or &quot;non-directed&quot;) or state-year data frame</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The function leans on attributes of the data that are provided by the <code>create_dyadyear()</code> or
<code>create_stateyear()</code> function. Make sure that function (or data created by that function) appear at the top
of the proverbial pipe.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>add_archigos()</code> takes a dyad-year or state-year data frame and adds a few summary
variables based off the leader-level data. These include whether there was a leader transition in the
state-year (or first/second state in the dyad-year), whether there was an &quot;irregular&quot; leader transition,
the number of leaders in the state-year, the unique leader ID for Jan. 1 of the year, and the unique leader
ID for Dec. 31 of the year.

<h2 id='add_atop_alliance'>Add Alliance Treaty Obligations and Provisions (ATOP) alliance data to a dyad-year data frame</h2><span id='topic+add_atop_alliance'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>add_atop_alliance()</code> allows you to add Alliance Treaty Obligations and Provisions (ATOP)
data to a (dyad-year, leader-dyad-year) data frame.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>add_atop_alliance(data)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr><td><code id="add_atop_alliance_+3A_data">data</code></td>
<td>
<p>a data frame with appropriate <span class="pkg">peacesciencer</span> attributes</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Data are from version 5.0 of ATOP.
</p>
<p>This function will also work with leader-dyad-years, though users should be careful with leader-level
applications of alliance data. Alliance data are primarily communicated yearly, making it possible&mdash;even
likely&mdash;that at least one leader-dyad in a given year is credited with an alliance that was not active in the particular
leader-dyad. The ATOP alliance data are not communicated with time measurements more granular than
the year, at least for dyad-years. The alliance-level data provided by ATOP do have termination dates, but I am unaware
how well these start and termination dates coincide with particular members joining after the fact or exiting early. The alliance
phase data appear to communicate that &quot;phases&quot; are understood as beginning/ending when the underlying document is amended in such a
way that it affects one of their variable codings, but this may or may not be because of a signatory joining after the fact or exiting
early. More guidance will be useful going forward, but use these data for leader-level analyses with that in mind.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>add_atop_alliance()</code> takes a (dyad-year, leader-dyad-year) data frame and adds information about
the alliance pledge in that given dyad-year from the ATOP data. These include whether there was an alliance
with a defense pledge, an offense pledge, neutrality pledge, non-aggression pledge, or pledge for consultation
in time of crisis.

<h2 id='add_capital_distance'>Add capital-to-capital distance to a data frame</h2><span id='topic+add_capital_distance'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>add_capital_distance()</code> allows you to add capital-to-capital
distance to a (dyad-year, leader-year, leader-dyad-year, state-year) data frame. The capitals are coded in the
<code>cow_capitals</code> and <code>gw_capitals</code>
data frames, along with their latitudes and longitudes. The distance variable that
emerges <code>capdist</code> is calculated using the &quot;Vincenty&quot; method (i.e. &quot;as the crow
flies&quot;) and is expressed in kilometers.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>add_capital_distance(data)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr><td><code id="add_capital_distance_+3A_data">data</code></td>
<td>
<p>a data frame with appropriate <span class="pkg">peacesciencer</span> attributes</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The function leans on attributes of the data that are provided by one of the &quot;create&quot; functions
in this package (e.g. <code>create_dyadyear()</code> or <code>create_stateyear()</code>).
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>add_capital_distance()</code> takes a (dyad-year, leader-year, leader-dyad-year, state-year) data frame and adds the
capital-to-capital distance between the first state and the second state (in dyad-year data) or the minimum
capital-to-capital distance for a given state in a given year. A minor
note about this function: cases of capital transition are recorded in the
underlying data but, in the conversion to capital-years (and eventual
merging into a dyad-year data frame), the Jan. 1 capital is used for calculating
distances.

<h2 id='add_ccode_to_gw'>Add Correlates of War state system codes to your data with Gleditsch-Ward state codes.</h2><span id='topic+add_ccode_to_gw'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>add_ccode_to_gw()</code> allows you to match, as well as one can, Correlates of War system membership data
with Gleditsch-Ward system data.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>add_ccode_to_gw(data)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr><td><code id="add_ccode_to_gw_+3A_data">data</code></td>
<td>
<p>a data frame with appropriate <span class="pkg">peacesciencer</span> attributes</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The <code>data-raw</code> directory on the project's Github contains
more information about the underlying data that assists in merging in
these codes.
</p>
<p>The user will invariably need to be careful and ask why they want these
data included. The issue here is that both have a different composition
and the merging process will not (and cannot) be perfect. We can note
that a case like Gran Colombia is not too difficult to handle (i.e.
CoW does not have this entity and none of the splinter states conflict
with CoW's coding). However, there is greater weirdness with a case like
the unification of West Germany and East Germany. Herein, Correlates of
War treats the unification as the reappearance of the original Germany
whereas Gleditsch-Ward treat the unification as an incorporation of
East Germany into West Germany. The script will <em>not</em> create state-year
or dyad-year duplicates for the Gleditsch-Ward codes. The size of the
original data remain unchanged. However, there will be some year
duplicates for various Correlates of War codes (prominently Serbia
and Yugoslavia in 2006). Use with care. You can also use the
<span class="pkg">countrycode</span> package. Whether you use this function or the
<span class="pkg">countrycode</span> package, do <em>not</em> do this kind of merging without
assessing the output.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>add_ccode_to_gw()</code> takes a (dyad-year, leader-year, leader-dyad-year, state-year) data frame that already has Gleditsch-Ward
state system codes and adds their corollary Correlates of War codes.

<h2 id='add_contiguity'>Add Correlates of War direct contiguity information to a data frame</h2><span id='topic+add_contiguity'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>add_contiguity()</code> allows you to add Correlates of War contiguity
data to a dyad-year, leader-year, or leader-dyad-year, or state-year data frame.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>add_contiguity(data)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr><td><code id="add_contiguity_+3A_data">data</code></td>
<td>
<p>a data frame with appropriate <span class="pkg">peacesciencer</span> attributes</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The contiguity codes in the dyad-year data range from 0 to 5.
1 = direct land contiguity. 2 = separated by 12 miles of water or
fewer (a la Stannis Baratheon). 3 = separated by 24 miles of water or
fewer (but more than 12 miles). 4 = separated by 150 miles
of water or fewer (but more than 24 miles). 5 = separated by 400 miles
of water or fewer (but more than 150 miles).
</p>
<p>Importantly, 0 are the dyads that are not contiguous at all in the CoW contiguity data.
This is a conscious decision on my part as I do not think of the CoW's contiguity data
as exactly ordinal. Cross-reference CoW's contiguity data with the minimum distance
data in this exact package to see how some dyads that CoW codes as not contiguous are
in fact very close to each other, sometimes even land-contiguous. For example, Zimbabwe and
Namibia are separated by only about a few hundred feet of water at that peculiar intersection of
the Zambezi River where the borders of Zambia, Botswana, Namibia, and Zimbabwe meet. There is
no contiguity record for this in the CoW data. There are other cases where contiguity records
are situationally missing (e.g. India-Bangladesh, and Bangladesh-Myanmar in 1971) or other cases where
states are much closer than CoW's contiguity data imply (e.g. Pakistan and the Soviet Union were separated by
under 30 kilometers of Afghani territory). The researcher is free to recode these 0s to be, say, 6s, but this
is why <span class="pkg">peacesciencer</span> does not do this.
</p>
<p>For additional clarity, the &quot;master records&quot; produce duplicates for cases when
the contiguity relationship changed in a given year. This function returns the
<em>minimum</em> contiguity relationship observed in that given year. There should be no
duplicates in the returned output.
</p>
<p>Be mindful that the data are fundamentally state-year and that extensions to
leader-level data should be understood as approximations for leaders in a
given state-year.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>add_contiguity()</code> takes a data frame and adds information
about the contiguity relationship based on the &quot;master records&quot; for the
Correlates of War direct contiguity data (v. 3.2). If the data are dyad-year
(or leader dyad-year), the function returns the lowest contiguity type
observed in the dyad-year (if contiguity is observed at all). If the data
are state-year (or leader-year), the data return the total number of
land and sea borders calculated from these master records.

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>add_cow_alliance()</code> allows you to add Correlates of War alliance
data to a dyad-year data frame
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>add_cow_alliance(data)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>

<td>
<p>a dyad-year or leader-dyad-year data frame (either &quot;directed&quot; or &quot;non-directed&quot;)</p>

</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Duplicates in the original directed dyad-year alliance data were pre-processed. Check
<code>cow_alliance</code> in the package's <code>data-raw</code> directory on Github for more information.
</p>
<p>This function will also work with leader-dyad-years, though users should be careful with leader-level
applications of alliance data. Alliance data are primarily communicated yearly, making it possible&mdash;even
likely&mdash;that at least one leader-dyad in a given year is credited with an alliance that was not active in the particular
leader-dyad. The Correlates of War's alliance data are not communicated with time measurements more granular than
the year. Apply these data to leader-level analyses with that in mind.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>add_cow_alliance()</code> takes a dyad-year data frame and adds information about
the alliance pledge in that given dyad-year. These include whether there was an alliance
with a defense pledge, neutrality pledge, non-aggression pledge, or pledge for consultation
in time of crisis (entente).

columns for whether the first state (i.e. <code>ccode1</code>) or the second
state (i.e. <code>ccode2</code>) are major powers in the given year, according
to the Correlates of War. 1 = is a major power. 0 = is not a major
power. If the data are state-year (or leader-year), the functions
returns just one column (<code>cowmaj</code>) for whether the
state was a major power in a given state-year.

(<code>year</code>), the presence or absence of an ongoing MID (<code>cowmidongoing</code>), and the presence or absence of a unique
MID onset (<code>cowmidonset</code>) are <em>always</em> returned. It would be foolish and self-defeating to eliminate those observations.
The user is free to keep or discard anything else they see fit.
</p>
<p>If <code>keep</code> is not specified in the function, the ensuing output returns everything.</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Dyads are capable of having multiple disputes in a given year, which can
create a problem for merging into a complete dyad-year data frame.
Consider the case of France and Italy in 1860, which
had three separate dispute onsets that year (MID#0112, MID#0113,
MID#0306), as illustrative of the problem. This merging process employs
several rules to whittle down these duplicate dyad-years for merging
into a dyad-year data frame.
</p>
<p>The function will also return a message to the user about the
case-exclusion rules that went into this process. Users who are
interested in implementing their own case-exclusion rules should
look up the &quot;whittle&quot; class of functions also provided in this
package.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>For the dyad-year (and leader-dyad-year) data, there must be some kind of information loss in order to work within the
limited space available to this package. This package loads a truncated version of the data in which the trade
values are rounded to three decimal points in order to greatly reduce the disk space for this package. I do not think this
to be terribly problematic, though I admit I do not like it. If this is a problem for your research question,
you may want to consider not using this function for dyad-year or leader-dyad-year data.
</p>
<p>Be mindful that the data are fundamentally state-year or dyad-year and that extensions to leader-level data should be understood
as approximations for leaders (leader-dyads) in a given state-year (dyad-year).
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>add_cow_trade()</code> takes a (dyad-year, leader-year, leader-dyad-year, state-year) data frame and
adds information about the volume of trade in that given dyad-year or state-year. For the state-year (leader-year)
data, these are minimally the sum of all imports and the sum of all exports. For dyad-year (leader-dyad-year) data,
this function returns the value of imports in current million USD in the first country from
the second country (and vice-versa) along with their &quot;smooth&quot; equivalents.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Intra-state war data are coerced into true state-year data by first

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>add_creg_fractionalization()</code> allows you to add information about the
fractionalization/polarization of a state's ethnic and religious groups to
your data.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>add_creg_fractionalization(data)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr><td><code id="add_creg_fractionalization_+3A_data">data</code></td>
<td>
<p>a data frame with appropriate <span class="pkg">peacesciencer</span> attributes</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Please see the information for the underlying data <code>creg</code>,
and the associated R script in the <code>data-raw</code> directory, to see how
these data are generated.
</p>
<p>The <code>creg</code> data have a few duplicates. When standardizing to true CoW
codes, the duplicates concern Serbia/Yugoslavia in 1991 and 1992 as well as
Russia/the Soviet Union in 1991. When standardizing to true Gleditsch-Ward
codes, the duplicates concern Serbia/Yugoslavia in 1991 and Russia/Soviet
Union in 1991. In those cases, the function does a group-by arrange for
the more fractionalized/polarized estimate under the (reasonable, I think)
assumption that these are estimates prior to the dissolution of those
states. If this is problematic, feel free to consult the underlying data
and merge those in manually.
</p>
<p>The underlying data have both Gleditsch-Ward codes and Correlates of War
codes. The merge it makes depends on what you declare as the &quot;master&quot;
system at the top of the pipe (i.e. in <code>create_dyadyears()</code> or
<code>create_stateyears()</code>). If, for example, you run
<code>create_stateyears(system="cow")</code> and follow it with
<code>add_gwcode_to_cow()</code>, the merge will be on the Correlates of War
codes and not the Gleditsch-Ward codes. You can see the script mechanics
to see how this is achieved.
</p>
<p>Be mindful that the data are fundamentally state-year and that extensions
to leader-level data should be understood as approximations for leaders
in a given state-year.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>add_creg_fractionalization()</code> takes a dyad-year, leader-year,
leader-dyad-year, or state-data frame, whether the primary state
identifiers are from the Correlates of War system or the Gleditsch-Ward
system, and  returns information about the fractionalization and
polarization of the state(s) in a given year. The function returns four
additional columns when the data are state-year and returns eight
additional columns when the data are state-year (or leader-year).
The columns returned are the fractionalization of ethnic groups, the
polarization of ethnic groups, the fractionalization of religious groups,
and the polarization of religious groups. When the data are dyad-year
(or leader-dyad-year), the return doubles because it provides information
for both states in the dyad.

<p>A vignette on the package's website talks about how these data are here
primarily to encourage you to maximize the number of observations in the
analysis to follow. Xavier Marquez' <code>QuickUDS</code> estimates have the best
coverage. If democracy is ultimately a control variable, or otherwise a
variable not of huge concern for the analysis (i.e. the user has no
particular stake on the best measurement of democracy or the best
conceptualization and operationalization of &quot;democracy&quot;), please
use Marquez' estimates instead of Polity or V-dem. If the user is
doing an analysis of inter-state conflict, and across the standard
post-1816 domain in conflict studies,  <em>definitely</em> don't use
the Polity data because the extent of its missingness is both large and
unnecessary. Please read the vignette describing these issues

<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>add_democracy()</code> takes a (dyad-year, leader-year, leader-dyad-year,

for the state or two states in the dyad in a given year. If the data are
dyad-year or leader-dyad-year, the function adds six total columns for
the first state  (i.e. <code>ccode1</code> or <code>gwcode1</code>) and the second state (i.e.

</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>For the dyad-year (and leader-dyad-year) data, there must be some kind of
information loss in order to reduce the disk space data like these command.
In this case, all calculations are rounded to three decimal spots. I do
not think this to be terribly problematic, though I admit I do not like it.
If this is a problem for your research question (though I can't imagine it
would be), you may want to consider not using this function for dyad-year
or leader-dyad-year data.
</p>
<p>Be mindful that the data are fundamentally dyad-year and that extensions to
leader-level data should be understood as approximations for leaders-dyads
in a given dyad-year.
</p>
<p>The data this function uses are directed dyad-year and the merge is a
left-join, making this function agnostic about whether your dyad-year
(or leader-dyad-year) data are directed or non-directed.
</p>
<p>Haege's (2011) article reads at first glance as agnostic about which of
these particular measures you should consider a &quot;preferred&quot; or &quot;default&quot;
measure of dyadic foreign policy similarity. Indeed, the 2011
publication in <em>Political Analysis</em> mostly drives the point home that
<em>S</em> has important limitations and the multiple variants Haege calculates
are not substitutable. This means a user interested in measuring
dyadic foreign policy similarity might have to cycle through all
of them to assess their varying effects whereas a user interested
in this as just a control variable for the model can (probably)
get by with picking just one and not belaboring the measure
any further.
</p>


<h4>Suggested Defaults</h4>

<p>An evaluation of the data, the article, and an email exchange
with the author leads to the following points the user should
consider. What follows is a rationale for why users should think of
kappa as a default measure for dyadic foreign policy similarity, though
why the &quot;valued&quot; equivalent for the alliance data is an inadvisable
default. The example at the end of the document offers the operational
&quot;nudge&quot; for what the user should want from this function.
</p>

<ul>
<li><p> The choice of measure will in part depend on the temporal
domain. If the user has just a post-WWII sample, the UN voting measures
offer better coverage. We're all partial to the alliance data, though,
because of its 19th century coverage.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Haege implores the use of chance-corrected measures, like Cohen's (1960)
kappa or Scott's (1955) pi. Of the two, Haege suggests kappa over pi. The
rationale is the user would need to build in a very strong assumption that
the baseline propensity of forming a tie in the dyad is the same for
both members of the dyad to make Scott's (1955) pi as appropriate an estimate
as Cohen's (1960) kappa even as both have the important chance correction.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The choice of squared versus absolute distances is arbitrary. Users
probably do not think about the differences, or know about the differences.
<em>S</em> was usually calculated with absolute differences in software packages,
though this was never usually belabored to the user. Comparability with <em>S</em>
might be an argument in favor of absolute distance as a default, but keep
in mind that squared distances are much more commonly used in most other
types of distance and association metrics.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The choice of binary or valued is also a design choice for the user to
consider on the full merits, though the practice of valuing alliance ties
on a quantitative scale builds in strong assumptions about the scale of
alliance strength as presented in something like the Correlates of War
or ATOP typology. <em>S</em> has traditionally done this by default, which is
another reason its application in a lot of quantitative peace science
research is suspect.

<h4>Citations for the Particular Similarity Measure You Choose</h4>

<p>Additional citations depend on what particular measure of similarity you're
using, whether Kendall's (1938) Tau-b, Signorino and Ritter's (1999) <em>S</em>,
Cohen's (1960) kappa and Scott's (1955) pi. Haege (2011) is part of a chorus
arguing against the use of <em>S</em>, though <em>S</em> measures are included in these
data if you elect to ignore the chorus and use this measure. Likewise, Tau-b
is in here, though it is not a good measure of dyadic foreign policy
similarity for reasons that Signorino and Ritter (1999) mention.
Haege (2011) argues for a chance-corrected measure of dyadic foreign policy
similarity, either Cohen's (1960) kappa or Scott's (1955) pi.

<h4>Citations for the Underlying Data Informing the Similarity Measure</h4>

<p>Haege (2011) also suggests you cite the underlying data informing the
similarity measure, whether it is UN voting or alliances. In his case,
he recommended a Voeten citation from 2013 and the alliance data proper.
In the case of the alliances, I know Gibler's (2009) book is recommended
even if the alliance data have since been updated (and reflected in this
measure). In the UN voting data, my understanding is the 2017 paper in
<em>Journal of Conflict Resolution</em> is also the preferred citation.

<p><code>add_gml_mids()</code> merges in GML's MID data to a (dyad-year, leader-year, leader-dyad-year, state-year) data frame. The current version
of the GML MID data is 2.2.1.

<p>an optional parameter, specified as a character vector, applicable to just the dyad-year data, and
passed to the function in a <code>select(one_of(.))</code> wrapper. This
allows the user to discard unwanted columns from the directed dispute data so that the output does not consume
too much space in memory. Note: the Correlates of War system codes (<code>ccode1</code>, <code>ccode2</code>), the observation year
(<code>year</code>), the presence or absence of an ongoing MID (<code>gmlmidongoing</code>), and the presence or absence of a unique
MID onset (<code>gmlmidonset</code>) are <em>always</em> returned. It would be foolish and self-defeating to eliminate those observations.
The user is free to keep or discard anything else they see fit.

appears as a summary return in the output) if the state was on Side A at the onset of the dispute. <code>"sidea-with-joiners"</code> = a state
initiates a MID (which appears as a summary return in the output) if the state was on Side A at the onset of the dispute or if the
state joined the MID on Side A. <code>"sidea-all-joiners"</code> = a state initiates a MID (which appears as a summary return in the output) if the
state was on Side A at the onset of the dispute or if it joined at any point thereafter. See details section for more discussion. The
default is  <code>"sidea-all-joiners"</code>.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Dyads are capable of having multiple disputes in a given year, which can
create a problem for merging into a complete dyad-year data frame.
Consider the case of France and Italy in 1860, which
had three separate dispute onsets that year (MID#0112, MID#0113,
MID#0306), as illustrative of the problem. This merging process employs
several rules to whittle down these duplicate dyad-years for merging
into a dyad-year data frame.
</p>
<p>The function will also return a message to the user about the
case-exclusion rules that went into this process. Users who are
interested in implementing their own case-exclusion rules should
look up the &quot;whittle&quot; class of functions also provided in this
package.
</p>
<p>Determining &quot;initiation&quot; for state-year summaries of inter-state disputes
is possible since there is an implied directionality of &quot;initiation.&quot;
In about half of all cases, this is straightforward. You can use the
participant summaries and determine that if the dispute was bilateral
and the dispute did not escalate beyond an attack, the state on Side A
initiated the dispute. For multilateral MIDs, these conditions still hold
at least for originators. However, there is <em>considerable</em> difficulty for
cases where 1) participant-level summaries suggested actions at the level of
clash or higher, 2) the participant was a joiner and not an originator.
The effort required to flesh this out is enormous, and perhaps
forthcoming in a future update.
</p>
<p><code>add_gml_mids()</code> allows you to make one of three judgment
calls here (see the arguments section of the documentation).
If it were my call to make, I would say you should probably use the option
<code>"sidea-all-joiners"</code>. My review of the MID data with Doug Gibler
suggests most states that join a dispute are not roped into a conflict
(i.e. targeted by some other state) after the first incident. They
routinely initiate their entry into the conflict, which is
what this concept of &quot;initiation&quot; is supposed to capture in the
literature. There are no doubt cases where some third state is brought into
the dispute by the actions of some other state even as the original MID
coding rules place a high barrier on coding that type of dispute entry.
However, the time required to individually assess whether a state initiated
their entry into a MID under something other than the simplest of cases
(e.g. bilateral cases where the highest participant action fell short of
a clash) would be too time-consuming. It would require an audit of almost
half of all participant-level summaries in the data. In a forthcoming
publication, Gibler and Miller offer excellent coverage here with a
new data set on militarized events. However, this would include only
confrontations after World War II.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>add_gml_mids()</code> takes a (dyad-year, leader-year, leader-dyad-year, state-year) data frame and adds
dispute information from the GML MID data. If the data are dyad-year, the return is a laundry list of information about onsets, ongoing conflicts,
and assorted participant- and dispute-level summaries. If the data are leader-dyad-year, these are carefully matched to leaders as well.
If the data are state-year or leader-year, the function returns information about ongoing disputes (and onsets) and
whether there were any ongoing disputes (and onsets) the state (or leader) initiated.

</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The <code>data-raw</code> directory on the project's Github contains more
information about the underlying data that assists in merging in these
codes.
</p>
<p>The user will invariably need to be careful and ask why they want
these data included. The issue here is that both have a different
composition and the merging process will not (and cannot) be perfect.
We can note that a case like Serbia/Yugoslavia is not too difficult
to handle (since &quot;Serbia&quot; never overlaps with &quot;Yugoslavia&quot; in the
Gleditsch-Ward data and Correlates of War understands Serbia as the
predecessor state, dominant state, and successor state to Yugoslavia).
However, there is greater weirdness with a case like Yemen/Yemen
Arab Republic. The script will <em>not</em> create state-year or dyad-year
duplicates for the Correlates of War codes. The size of the original data
remain unchanged. However, there will be some year duplicates for various
Gleditsch-Ward codes (e.g. Yemen, again). Use with care. You can also use
the <span class="pkg">countrycode</span> package. Whether you use this function or the
<span class="pkg">countrycode</span> package, do <em>not</em> do this kind of merging without
assessing the output.

the number of IGOs for which the state is a full member, the number of IGOs for which the state is an associate member, the
number of IGOs for which the state is an observer, and the number of IGOs for which the state is involved in any way (i.e. the
sum of the other three columns).

<p>The letter published by Carter and Smith (2020) contains more information
as to what these thetas refer. The &quot;M1&quot; theta is a variation of the standard
Rasch model from the boilerplate information in the LEAD data. The authors
consider this to be &quot;theoretically relevant&quot; or &quot;risk-related&quot; as these all
refer to conflict or risk-taking. The &quot;M2&quot; theta expands on &quot;M1&quot; by
including political orientation and psychological characteristics. &quot;M3&quot; and
&quot;M4&quot; expand on &quot;M1&quot; and &quot;M2&quot; by considering all 36 variables in the LEAD
data.
</p>
<p>The authors construct and include all these measures, though their analyses
suggest &quot;M2&quot; is the best-performing measure. You should probably consider
using <code>theta2_mean</code> as your default estimate of leader willingness
to use force in leader-year analyses.

<code>sbtscs()</code> leans heavily on <code>btscs()</code> from <span class="pkg">DAMisc</span>. I optimized some code for performance.
</p>
<p>Importantly, the underlying function (<code>sbtscs()</code> in <span class="pkg">stevemisc</span>, by way of <code>btscs()</code> in <span class="pkg">DAMisc</span>)
has important performance issues if you're trying to run it when your event data are sandwiched by observations
without any event data. Here's what I mean. Assume you got the full Gleditsch-Ward state-year data from 1816 to 2020
and then added the UCDP armed conflict data to it. If you want the peace-years for this, the function will fail because
every year from 1816 to 1945 (along with 2020, as of writing) have no event data. You can force the function to &quot;not fail&quot;
by setting <code>pad = TRUE</code> as an argument, but it's not clear this is advisable for this reason. Assume you wanted event data
in UCDP for just the extrasystemic onsets. The data start in 1946 and, in 1946, the United Kingdom,
Netherlands, and France had extrasystemic conflicts. For <em>all</em> years before 1946, the events are imputed as 1
for those countries that had 1s in the first year of observation and everyone else is NA and implicitly assumed to be a zero.
For those NAs, the function runs a sequence resulting in some wonky spells in 1946 that are not implied by (the absence of) the
data. In fact, none of those are implied by the absence of data before 1946.
</p>
<p>The function works just fine if you truncate your temporal domain to reflect the nature of your event data. Basically,
if you want to use this function more generally, filter your dyad-year or state-year data to make sure there are no years
without any event data recorded (e.g. why would you have a CoW-MID analyses of dyad-years with observations before 1816?). This
is less a problem when years with all-NAs succeed (and do not precede) the event data. For example, the UCDP conflict data
run from 1946 to 2019 (as of writing). Having 2020 observations in there won't compromise the function output when <code>pad = TRUE</code>
is included as an argument.
</p>
<p>Finally, <code>add_peace_years()</code> will only calculate the peace years and will leave the temporal dependence adjustment
to the taste of the researcher. Importantly, I do not recommend manually creating splines or square/cube terms because
it creates more problems in adjusting for temporal dependence in model predictions. In a regression formula in R,
you can specify the Carter and Signorino (2010) approach as
<code>... + gmlmidspell + I(gmlmidspell^2) + I(gmlmidspell^3)</code> (assuming you ran <code>add_peace_years()</code> on a dyad-year data frame
including the Gibler-Miller-Little conflict data).
The Beck et al. cubic splines approach is <code>... + splines::bs(gmlmidspell, 4)</code>. This function includes
the spell and three splines (hence the 4 in the command). Either approach makes for easier model predictions,
given R's functionality.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>add_peace_years()</code> takes a dyad-year or state-year data frame and adds peace years for ongoing conflicts.
Dyadic conflict data supported include the Correlates of War (CoW) Militarized Interstate Dispute (MID) data set and the
Gibler-Miller-Little (GML) corrections to CoW-MID. State-level conflict data supported in this function include the UCDP
armed conflict data and the CoW intra-state war data.

<h2 id='add_rugged_terrain'>Add rugged terrain information to a data frame</h2><span id='topic+add_rugged_terrain'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>add_rugged_terrain()</code> allows you to add information, however crude,
about the &quot;ruggedness&quot; of a state's terrain to your (dyad-year, leader-year, leader-dyad-year, state-year) data.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>add_rugged_terrain(data)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr><td><code id="add_rugged_terrain_+3A_data">data</code></td>
<td>
<p>a data frame with appropriate <span class="pkg">peacesciencer</span> attributes</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Please see the information for the underlying data <code>rugged</code>, and the
associated R script in the <code>data-raw</code> directory, to see how these data are generated.
Importantly, these data are time-agnostic and move <em>slowly</em>. We're talking about geography here.
Both data sets benchmark around 1999-2000 and it's a leap of faith to use these data for comparisons
across the entirety of the Correlates of War or Gleditsch-Ward system membership. Every use of data
of these types have been either cross-sectional snapshots or for making state-to-state comparisons
after World War II (think of your prominent civil war studies here). Be mindful about what you expect
to get from these data.
</p>
<p>The underlying data have both Gleditsch-Ward codes and Correlates of War codes. The merge it makes depends
on what you declare as the &quot;master&quot; system at the top of the pipe (e.g.. in <code>create_dyadyears()</code> or
<code>create_stateyears()</code>). If, for example, you run <code>create_stateyears(system="cow")</code> and follow
it with <code>add_gwcode_to_cow()</code>, the merge will be on the Correlates of War codes and not the Gleditsch-Ward
codes. You can see the script mechanics to see how this is achieved.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>add_rugged_terrain()</code> takes a (dyad-year, leader-year, leader-dyad-year, state-year)
data frame, whether the primary state identifiers are from the Correlates of War
system or the Gleditsch-Ward system, and returns information about the
&quot;ruggedness&quot; of the state's terrain. The two indicators returned are the
&quot;terrain ruggedness index&quot; calculated by Nunn and Puga (2012) and a logarithmic
transformation of how mountainous the state is (as calculated by Gibler and Miller, 2014).
The dyad-year (leader-dyad-year) data get four additional columns (i.e. both indicators for both states
in the dyad) whereas the state-year data get just the two additional columns.

<h3>Arguments</h3>

<p>a data frame with appropriate <span class="pkg">peacesciencer</span> attributes</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The function leans on attributes of the data that are provided by one of
the &quot;create&quot; functions. Make sure a recognized function (or data created
by that function) appear at the top of the proverbial pipe. Users will
also want to note that the underlying function access two different data
sets. It appears that the results published in the
<em>International Studies Quarterly</em> used Correlates of War classification,
but a follow-up repository on Github uses Gleditsch-Ward classification.
The extent to which these estimates are generated by simulation, it does
mean the estimates will be slightly different across both data sets even
for common observations (e.g. the United States in 1816).
</p>
<p>Because these are large nominal numbers, the estimates have been
log-transformed. Users can always exponentiate these if they choose.
Researchers can use these data to construct reasonable estimates of
surplus GDP per capita, but must exponentiate the underlying variables
before doing this.
</p>
<p>Be mindful that the data are fundamentally state-year and that extensions
to leader-level data should be understood as approximations for leaders in
a given state-year.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>add_sdp_gdp()</code> takes a (dyad-year, leader-year, leader-dyad-year,
state-year)  data frame and adds information about the estimated gross
domestic product (in 2011 USD) for that year, the estimated population
in that year, the GDP per capita in that year, and what Anders, Fariss
and Markowitz term the &quot;surplus domestic product&quot; in that year. If the
data are dyad-year (leader-dyad-year), the function adds eight total
columns for the first state (i.e. <em>ccode1</em>) and the second state
(i.e. <em>ccode2</em>) for all these estimates. If the data are state-year
(or leader-year), the function returns four additional columns to the
original data that contain that same information for a given state in
a given year.

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>add_spells()</code> calculates &quot;spells&quot; in your state-year, leader-year,

things like &quot;peace spells&quot; between conflicts in a given cross-sectional
unit (e.g. a state or dyad).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>add_spells(data, conflict_event_type = "ongoing", ongo = FALSE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The function internally uses <code>ps_spells()</code> from <span class="pkg">stevemisc</span>. In
the interest of full disclosure, <code>ps_spells()</code> leans heavily on
<code>add_duration()</code> from <span class="pkg">spduration</span>. I optimized some code
for performance.
</p>
<p>Thinking of an application like peace-years, <code>add_spells()</code> will
only calculate the peace years and will leave the temporal dependence
adjustment to the taste of the researcher. Importantly, I do not recommend
manually creating splines or square/cube terms because it creates more
problems in adjusting for temporal dependence in model predictions.
In a regression formula in R, you can specify the Carter and Signorino
(2010) approach as
<code>... + gmlmidspell + I(gmlmidspell^2) + I(gmlmidspell^3)</code> (assuming
you ran <code>add_spells()</code> on a dyad-year data frame including the
Gibler-Miller-Little conflict data). The Beck et al. cubic splines approach
is <code>... + splines::bs(gmlmidspell, 4)</code>. This function includes the
spell and three splines (hence the 4 in the command). Either approach
makes for easier model predictions, given R's functionality.
</p>
<p>Thinking of our dyadic analyses of conflict, I've always understood
that something like &quot;peace-years&quot; should be calculated on the ongoing
event and not the onset of the event. Think of something like the
Iran-Iraq War (MID#2115) as illustrative here. The MID (which became
a war) started in 1980 and ended in 1988. There are no other bilateral
incidents between Iran-Iraq independent of the war, per Correlates of War
coding rules. If peace years are calculated at the &quot;onset&quot; of the event,
it would list peace-years between the two countries from 1981 to 1988.
I've never understood that to make sense, but still I've seen others insist
this is the correct way to do it. <code>add_peace_years()</code> would force the
calculation on the ongoing event, which I still maintain is correct.
<code>add_spells()</code> will allow you to calculate on onsets, even if
ongoing events are the default.
</p>
<p>The underlying function for <code>add_spells()</code> will stop without a return
if there are NAs bracketing observed events. The surest way
this will happen is if you're doing something like a dyad-year analysis
of inter-state conflicts from 1816 to 2010, but <code>create_dyadyears()</code>
created observations from 2011 to 2020 for you as well. Remove those
before using this function and confine the temporal domain to just those
time-units (e.g. years) for which there is observed event data.
See what I do in the example below.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>add_spells()</code> takes a dyad-year, leader-year, or  state-year data
frame and adds spells for ongoing conflicts. Dyadic conflict data supported
include the Correlates of War (CoW) Militarized Interstate Dispute (MID)
data set and the Gibler-Miller-Little (GML) corrections to CoW-MID.
State-level conflict data supported in this function include the UCDP
armed conflict data and the CoW intra-state war data. Leader-year
conflict data supported include the GML MID data.

<td>
<p>optional, relevant for state-year, takes a value of 1, 2, or 3 to look for
whether one of three types fits criteria for ideological, interventionary, positional, spatial
rivalry. Defaults to 1.</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>add_strategic_rivalries()</code> will include some other information derived from the rivalry data that the
user may not want (e.g. start year of the rivalry). Feel free to select those out after the fact. Function includes
an on-the-fly adjustment for Austria for rivalry #79. In this case, the Austria-Serbia rivalry continues for two years
after Austria-Hungary (<code>ccode: 300</code>) became Austria (<code>ccode: 305</code>).
</p>
<p>The <code>across_types</code> argument is optional and observed for only state-year calls. It defaults to 1. At the default,
the function looks into the rivalry data (in <code>td_rivalries</code>) and focuses on the <code>type1</code> column. If, say, a state has
an ongoing rivalry and it is primarily spatial, it codes that as a spatial rivalry. Assume you input <code>across_types = 2</code>, the
function then looks across both the <code>type1</code> and <code>type2</code> columns to see if there is a spatial component to the rivalry as
either its primary or secondary dimension. If so, it codes that as a 1. <code>across_types</code> must be 1, 2, or 3.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>add_strategic_rivalries()</code> takes a dyad-year data frame and adds information about ongoing strategic rivalries. It
will also include a simple dummy variable for whether there was an ongoing rivalry in the year or not.
For state-year data, it returns the count of ongoing strategic rivalries for the state in the year meeting a certain criteria (i.e.
whether the state has an interventionary, ideological, positional, or spatial rivalry in an ongoing year, and how many).

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Right now, only state-year data are supported. It's worth saying
that &quot;both&quot; in the <code>issue</code> argument should not be understood as
equivalent to <code>c("territory","government")</code>. The former is a kind of
&quot;AND&quot; (in boolean speak) and is an explicit category in the data. The latter
is an &quot;OR&quot; (in boolean speak) and is in all likelihood what you want if you
are tempted to specify &quot;both&quot; in the <code>issue</code> argument.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>add_ucdp_acd()</code> takes a state-year data frame and returns state-year information from the
UCDP Armed Conflict data set (v. 20.1). The variables returned are whether there is an ongoing armed
conflict in that year, whether there was an armed conflict episode onset that year, what was the maximum
intensity observed that year (if an armed conflict was observed), and a character vector of the associated
conflict IDs that year.

<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr><td><code id="add_ucdp_onsets_+3A_data">data</code></td>
<td>
<p>a  state-year data frame</p>

</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The function leans on attributes of the data that are provided by the <code>create_dyadyear()</code> or
<code>create_stateyear()</code> function. Make sure that function (or data created by that function) appear at the top
of the proverbial pipe. The underlying data are version 19.1. Importantly, the UCDP yearly onset data are nominally state-year,
but technically state-dyad-episode-year for cases of onsets. For example, there are four France-1946 observations because of four
new conflict episodes with Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam. There are two Panama-1989 episodes, one for the invasion by
the United States and another for a failed coup attempt. That means the are duplicates in the original data that I process
into summaries. The user will probably want to consider some kind of recoding here.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>add_ucdp_onsets()</code> takes a state-year data frame and adds a few summary
variables based off armed conflict onsets data provided by UCDP. The variables returned are
the sum of new conflict dyads (should they exist) in a given state-year, and the sum of new onset episodes (or new conflicts) that are
separated by one, two, three, five, or 10 years since the last conflict episode.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Space considerations mean I can only offer a few columns from the
overall data. Archigos data are rich with information. Consult the raw data
available on Hein Goeman's website for more.
</p>
<p>To best conform with data requirements on CRAN, a few leader names were
renamed if they included irregular characters (e.g. umlauts or accents).
These leaders, in these particular applications, hav been renamed to &quot;(Juan
Orlando) Hernandez&quot; (<code>HON-2014</code>), &quot;(Antonio) Saca Gonzalez&quot; (<code>SAL-2004</code>),
&quot;Julian Trujillo Largacha&quot; (<code>COL-1878</code>), &quot;Cesar Gaviria Trujillo&quot;
(<code>COL-1990</code>), &quot;Gabriel Garcia Moreno&quot; (<code>ECU-1869</code>), &quot;Marcos A. Morinigo&quot;
(<code>PAR-1894-1</code>), &quot;Higinio Morinigo&quot; (<code>PAR-1940</code>), &quot;Sebastian Pinera&quot;
(<code>CHL-2010</code>), &quot;Sauli Niinisto&quot; (<code>FIN-2012</code>), &quot;Louis Gerhard De Geer&quot;
(<code>SWD-1876</code>), &quot;Stefan Lofven&quot; (<code>SWD-2014</code>), &quot;Lars Lokke Rasmussen&quot;
(<code>DEN-2009</code>, <code>DEN-2015</code>), and &quot;Fernando de Araujo&quot; (<code>ETM-2008-1</code>). None of
these names contain these special characters in the data here.
</p>
<p>For clarity's sake, I renamed the <code>ccode</code> column in the raw data to be
<code>gwcode</code>. This is because it may deceive the user peeking into the data
that these are not Correlates of War state codes, but Gleditsch-Ward
state codes.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The directed dyad-year alliance data are for alliance initiations, not straight dyad-years, &quot;per se.&quot; This suggests
the presence of duplicate directed dyad-years. For computing ease, given the intended use, I take care of these duplicate
dyad-years behind the scenes. Consider the case of the U.S. and Canada in 1958. Therein, there were apparently two separate
alliance initiations  that included defense pledges. My behind-the-scenes cleaning process groups by <code>ccode1</code>,
<code>ccode2</code>, and <code>year</code> and summarizes those alliance pledge variables. I then replace any value greater than 1
with 1. This indicates the presence or absence of a defense pledge in a given directed dyad-year.

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This is a complete list of capitals and capital transitions for Correlates of War state system members. I
use it internally for calculating capital-to-capital distances in the <code>add_capital_distances()</code> function.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>cow_capitals
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 252 observations on the following 7 variables.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>ccode</code></dt><dd><p>a numeric vector for the Correlates of War state code</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>statenme</code></dt><dd><p>a character vector for the state</p>

</dd>
<dt><code>lng</code></dt><dd><p>a numeric vector of the longitude coordinates for the capital</p>
</dd>
</dl>



<h3>Details</h3>

<p>For convenience, the start year for most states is 1816. Samoa, for example, was not a state
in 1816. However, the functions that use the <code>cow_capitals</code> data will not create observations for states
that did not exist at a given point in time.
</p>
<p>The data should be current as of the end of 2020.
</p>
<p>Cases where a start year is not 1816 indicate a capital transition. For example, Brazil's capital moved from
Rio de Janeiro to Brasilia (a planned capital) in 1960. Only 25 states in the data experienced a capital transition.
The most recent was Burundi in 2018. Indonesia, as of writing, is planning on a capital transition, but this has not
been completed yet.
</p>
<p>Kazakhstan renamed its capital for the state leader in 2019. These data retain the name of Astana. This will be changed
in the event the software I use records this change.
</p>
<p>The capitals data are not without some peculiarities. Prominently, Portugal transferred the Portuguese court from
Lisbon to Rio de Janeiro from 1808 to 1821. <em>This is recorded in the data.</em> A knowledge of the inter-state conflict data
will note there was no war or dispute between, say, Portugal and Spain (or Portugal and any other country) at any point
during this time, but it does create some weirdness that would suggest a massive distance between two countries, like
Portugal and Spain, that are otherwise land-contiguous.
</p>
<p>On Spain: the republican government moved the capital at the start of the civil war (in 1936) to Valencia. However, it
abandoned this capital by 1937. I elect to not record this capital transition.
</p>
<p>The data also do some (I think) reasonable back-dating of capitals to coincide with states in transition without
necessarily formal capitals by the first appearance in the state system membership data. These concern Lithuania,
Kazakhstan, and the Philippines. Kaunas is the initial post-independence capital of Lithuania. Almaty is the initial
post-independence capital of Kazakhstan. Quezon City is the initial post-independence capital of the Philippines.
This concerns, at the most, one or two years for each of these three countries.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 2025840 observations on the following 4 variables.

</dl>



<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The &quot;master record&quot; provided by the Correlates of War is &quot;non-directed.&quot; I make
these data &quot;directed&quot; for convenience.
</p>
<p>For clarity, the contiguity codes range from 1 to 5. 1 = direct land contiguity. 2 =
separated by 12 miles of water or fewer (a la Stannis Baratheon). 3 = separated by
24 miles of water or fewer (but more than 12 miles). 4 = separated by 150 miles
of water or fewer (but more than 24 miles). 5 = separated by 400 miles of water
or fewer (but more than 150 miles). Cases of separation by more than 400 miles
of water are not included in the master record (but are easily discerned based on
complete dyad-year data).

fit. Data are extended to 2020, assuming no changes to state system membership for either data set.

<p>The process of creating these is described at one of the references below. Importantly, these data are somewhat
&quot;naive.&quot; That is: they won't tell you, for example, that Brazil and Japan never directly fought each other during World War II.
Instead, it will tell you that there were two years of overlap for the two on different sides of the conflict and that the highest
action for both was a war. The data are thus similar to what the <code>EUGene</code> program would create for users back in the day. Use these

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>These data are purposely light on information; they're not intended to be used for dispute-level analyses, per se.
They're intended to augment the directed dyadic dispute-year data by adding in variables that serve as exclusion rules to whittle
the data from dyadic dispute-year to just dyad-year data.

<h2 id='cow_mindist'>The Minimum Distance Between States in the Correlates of War System, 1886-2019</h2><span id='topic+cow_mindist'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>These are non-directed dyad-year data for the minimum distance between states in the Correlates of War state system from
1886 to 2019. The data are generated from the <span class="pkg">cshapes</span> package.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>cow_mindist
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 817053 observations on the following 4 variables.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>ccode1</code></dt><dd><p>the Correlates of War state system code for the first state</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>ccode2</code></dt><dd><p>the Correlates of War state system code for the second state</p>

<dt><code>year</code></dt><dd><p>the year</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>mindist</code></dt><dd><p>the minimum distance between states on Jan. 1 of the year, in kilometers</p>
</dd>
</dl>



<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The data are generated from the <span class="pkg">cshapes</span> package. Data are automatically generated
(by default) as directed dyad-years. I elect to make them non-directed for space considerations.
Making non-directed dyad-year data into directed dyad-year data isn't too difficult in R. It just
looks weird to see the code that does it.
</p>
<p>Previous versions of these data were for the minimum distance as of Dec. 31 of the referent year. These are now Jan. 1.
Most of the data I provide elsewhere in this package are  to be understood as the data as they were at the <em>start</em> of
the year. This is how I process, for example, the <code>capitals</code> data as they get merged in the <code>add_capital_distance()</code>
function. However, the script that generates these data are set at Jan. 1 of the year and not Dec. 31. Right now, the <span class="pkg">cshapes</span>
does not appear to work on my system and I do not know why. Fortunately, the package authors made these data available.

</dd>
</dl>



<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The user will want to be a little careful with how some of these data are used, beyond the typical caveat
about how difficult it is to pin-point how many thousands of coal-tons a state like Baden was producing in the 19th century.
</p>
<p>First, military expenditures are denominated in British pounds sterling for observations between 1816 and 1913. The observations
from 1914 and beyond are denominated in current United States dollars. This is according to the manual.
</p>
<p>Second, urban population size is an estimate based on, well, an estimate of the size of the population living in an area with 100,000
or more people.
</p>
<p>Third, the Composite Index of National Capability score is calculated as each state's world share of each of the six composite indicators
also included in the data in a given year. It theoretically is bound between 0 and 1. A state with a 1 is 100% responsible for 1) all of the military expenditures
in the world, 2) is the only state with a military, 3) does all the iron and steel production, 4) all the world's primary energy consumption, and 5)
is the only state in the world with a population and an urban population. Incidentally, the maximum scores observed in the data belong to the United States in 1945.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>These were extracted from the actual replication files from <em>International Studies Quarterly</em>. Because these
data are ultimately being simulated, a user can expect some slight differences between the Correlates of War version of these data
(which Anders et al. published) and the Gleditsch-Ward version of these data (which appear to be the one the authors will more
vigorously support going forward).
</p>
<p>Space considerations compel me to round these data to three decimal points.  These &quot;economic&quot; data are routinely
the biggest in the package, and it's because of the decimal points. The justification for this is these data are estimated/simulated
anyways and the information loss is at the 1/1000th decimal point. This procedure basically cuts the size of the data to be less than
25% of its original size. The original simulations are available for remote download if you'd like. Type <code>?download_extdata()</code> for
more information.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>See <code>data-raw</code> directory for how these data were generated. These data are here if you want it, but I caution against using them
as gospel. There are a few problems here. One: -9s proliferate the data for battle deaths on either side, which is unhelpful. There are 10 cases where the sum
of battle deaths is exactly 1,000 or 1,001. This is suspicious. The &quot;side&quot; variables are not well-explained&mdash;in fact they're not explained at all in the codebook&mdash;
and this can lead a user astray if they want to interpret them analogous to the <code>sidea</code> variables in the Correlates of War Militarized Interstate Dispute
data. You probably want to use the initiator variables for this. Further, the war data routinely betray the MID data and the two do not speak well to each other. The language Sarkees and Wayman (2010) use in their book
talk about how MIDs &quot;precede&quot; a war or are &quot;associated&quot; with a war, which forgets the war data are supposed to be a subset of the MID data. In one case (Gulf War),
they get the associated dispute number wrong and, in one prominent case (War of Bosnian Independence), they argue no MID exists at all (it's actually MID#3557).

<h2 id='create_dyadyears'>Create dyad-years from state system membership data</h2><span id='topic+create_dyadyears'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>create_dyadyears()</code> allows you to dyad-year data from
either the Correlates of War (<code>CoW</code>) state system membership data or the
Gleditsch-Ward (<code>gw</code>) system membership data. The function leans on internal
data provided in the package.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>create_dyadyears(system = "cow", mry = TRUE, directed = TRUE, subset_years)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr><td><code id="create_dyadyears_+3A_system">system</code></td>
<td>
<p>a character specifying whether the user wants Correlates of War
state-years (&quot;cow&quot;) or Gleditsch-Ward (&quot;gw&quot;) state-years. Correlates of War is the
default.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="create_dyadyears_+3A_mry">mry</code></td>
<td>
<p>optional, defaults to TRUE. If TRUE, the function extends the script
beyond the most recent system membership updates to include observation to the
most recently concluded calendar year. For example, the Gleditsch-Ward data extend
to the end of 2017. When <code>mry == TRUE</code>, the function returns more recent years
(e.g. 2018, 2019) under the assumption that states alive at the end of 2017 are still alive
today. Use with some care.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="create_dyadyears_+3A_directed">directed</code></td>
<td>
<p>optional, defaults to TRUE. If TRUE, the function returns so-called
&quot;directed&quot; dyad-year data. In directed dyad-year data, France-Germany (220-255) and
Germany-France (255-220) are observationally different. If FALSE, the function returns
non-directed data. In non-directed data, France-Germany and Germany-France in the same year
are the same observation. The standard here is to drop cases where the country code for the
second observation is less than the country code for the first observation.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="create_dyadyears_+3A_subset_years">subset_years</code></td>
<td>
<p>and optional character vector for subsetting the years
returned to just some temporal domain of interest to the user. For example,
<code>c(1816:1820)</code> would subset the data to just all dyad-years in 1816, 1817,
1818, 1819, and 1820. Be advised that it's easiest to subset the data after
the full universe of dyad-year data have been created. This means you could,
if you choose, effectively overwrite <code>mry = TRUE</code> with this argument since
the <code>mry</code> argument is applied at the expansion of the state system data,
which occurs at the start of the function.</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>create_dyadyears()</code> takes state system membership data provided
by either Correlates of War or Gleditsch-Ward and returns a dyad-year data frame.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This is a <em>complete</em> and <em>universal</em> leader dyad-year data frame for all possible dyadic
leader pairings from 1870 to 2015. This has several implications. First: these data are enormous. The
output is over 2 million rows long! Second: the time required to create these data from scratch would
take too long for a normal function call. This amounts to an unholy combination of data that are too large
for CRAN's disk space restrictions (5 MB) and too time-consuming to do from scratch every time. Thus, the
data are pre-generated and stored remotely. Check <code>download_extdata()</code> for more information.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>create_leaderdyadyears()</code> takes remote data available for separate download
and returns a complete leader dyad-year data frame for all leaders, and all possible dyads,
from 1870 to 2015.

</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>create_leaderyears()</code>, as of writing, only supports the
Archigos data set of leaders.
</p>
<p>Many leader ages are known with precision. Many are not recorded in the
Archigos data. Knowing well that years are aggregates of days, the leader
age variable that gets returned in this output should be treated as an
approximation of the leader's age.
</p>
<p>Be mindful that leader tenure is calculated <em>before</em> any standardization
argument. Archigos has some leader entries that precede the state system
entry for the state, or otherwise do not coincide with state system dates.
For example, Lynden Pindling was in his seventh year as leader of The
Bahamas (in various titles) before independence in 1973 (in which he became
prime minister). Leader tenure is not tethered to state system dates in
situations like this (only the dates recorded in the Archigos data).
</p>
<p>The leader tenure variable returned here does have the odd effect of
potentially misstating leader tenure, or at least making it seem unusual.
For example, Jimmy Carter (<code>USA-1877</code>) was president in 1977 (year 1),
1978 (year 2), 1979 (year 3), 1980 (year 4), and exited in January 1981
(year 5). Again: years are aggregates of days and it's not evident how else
this information should be perfectly communicated with that in mind. Users
with some R skills can extract the underlying information from the
<code>archigos</code> data and, perhaps, calculate something like the maximum
leader tenure (in days) on either Dec. 31 of the referent year, or leader
exit before Dec. 31 that year, or something to that effect. No matter, I
think this to at least be a defensible variable to present to the user
with those limitations in mind. If the user is interested in leader tenure
in a leader-year analysis, this variable should be fine. If the user is
interested in something like the effect of a fifth year on some kind of
leader behavior, they will want to figure out something else.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>create_leaderyears()</code> takes leader-level data available in
<span class="pkg">peacesciencer</span> and returns a leader-year-level data frame. This minimal
output contains the observation ID from Archigos, the year, the state code
for the leader (i.e. either Correlates of War or Gleditsch-Ward, depending
on the <code>standardize</code> argument), the leader's name in Archigos (if it
may help the reader to have that), an approximation of the leader's age,
and the year in office for the leader (as a running count, starting at 1).

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The <code>data-raw</code> directory on the project's Github contains more information about how these data were
created. Pay careful attention to how I assigned CoW/G-W codes. The underlying data are version 1.02.
</p>
<p>The state codes provided by the CREG project are mostly Correlates of War codes, but with some differences.
Summarizing these differences: the state code for Serbia from 1992 to 2013 is actually the Gleditsch-Ward code (340).
Russia after the dissolution of the Soviet Union (1991-onward) is 393 and not 365. The Soviet Union has the 365 code.
Yugoslavia has the 345 code. The code for Yemen (678) is effectively the Gleditsch-Ward code because it spans the entire
post-World War II temporal domain. Likewise, the code for post-unification Germany is the Gleditsch-Ward code (260) as well.
The codebook actually says it's 265 (which would be East Germany's code), but this is assuredly a typo based on the data.
</p>
<p>The codebook cautions there are insufficient data for ethnic group estimates for Cameroon, France, India,
Kosovo, Montenegro, Mozambique, and Papua New Guinea. The French case is particularly disappointing but the
missing data there are a function of both France's constitution and modelling issues for CREG (per the
codebook). There are insufficient data to make religious group estimates for China, North Korea, and the
short-lived Republic of Vietnam.
</p>
<p>The fractionalization estimates are the familiar Herfindahl-Hirschman concentration index. The polarization
formula comes by way of Montalvo and Reynal-Querol (2000), though this book does not appear to be published
beyond its placement online. I recommend Montalvo and Reynal-Querol (2005) instead.
You can cite Alesina (2003) for the fractionalization measure if you'd like.
</p>
<p>In the most literal sense of &quot;1&quot;, the group proportions may not sum to exactly 1 because of rounding in the
data. There were only two problem cases in these data worth mentioning. First, in both data sets, there would
be the occasional duplicates of group names by state-year (for example: Afghanistan in 1951 in the ethnic group
data and the United States in 1948 in the religious group data). In those cases, the script I make available
in the <code>data-raw</code> directory just select distinct values and that effectively fixes the problem of duplicates,
where they do appear. Finally, Costa Rica had a curious problem for most years in the religious group data. All
Costa Rica years have group data for Protestants, Roman Catholics, and &quot;others.&quot; Up until 1964 or so, the &quot;others&quot;
are zero. Afterward, there is some small proportion of &quot;others&quot;. However, the sum of Protestants, Roman Catholics, and
&quot;others&quot; exceeds 1 (pretty clearly) and the difference between the sum and 1 is entirely the &quot;others.&quot; So, I drop
the &quot;others&quot; for all years. I don't think that's terribly problematic, but it's worth saying that's what I did.

<h2 id='declare_attributes'>Declare <span class="pkg">peacesciencer</span>-specific attributes to data</h2><span id='topic+declare_attributes'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>declare_attributes()</code> allows the user to
declare <span class="pkg">peacesciencer</span>-specific attributes to data they
bring from outside the package. This allows the user to use
package functions as shortcuts, where appropriate.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>declare_attributes(data, data_type, system, conflict_type)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr><td><code id="declare_attributes_+3A_data">data</code></td>
<td>
<p>a data frame for which you want <span class="pkg">peacesciencer</span>-specific attributes</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="declare_attributes_+3A_data_type">data_type</code></td>
<td>
<p>optional, but a character vector of length 1 coinciding with the type of data the user believes
the data frame is. Options include: 'dyad_year', 'leader_day', 'leader_year', 'leader_dyad_year', 'state_day', or 'state_year'.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="declare_attributes_+3A_system">system</code></td>
<td>
<p>optional, but a character vector of length 1 coinciding with the state system of the data. If specified at all,
must be 'cow' or 'gw'.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="declare_attributes_+3A_conflict_type">conflict_type</code></td>
<td>
<p>optional, and applicable to just conflict data and the &quot;whittle&quot; class functions in <span class="pkg">peacesciencer</span>. If specified,
must be a character vector of length 1 that is either 'cow' or 'gml'.</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The function's documentation will include what attributes
are available to be declared. No doubt, the list of potential
attributes will grow in time, but the attributes that can be declared
are limited to just what I've built into the package to this
point. Users cannot declare more than one attribute of a given
type (i.e. a user cannot declare the system to be both Correlates of War
and Gleditsch-Ward).
</p>
<p>The idea here is, basically, to allow the user to use functions in
<span class="pkg">peacesciencer</span> for data they have created or have acquired from
elsewhere. However, this functions provides <em>no</em> assurances about quality
control in the various merges built elsewhere into this package. This package
aggressively tests functions for data generated in-house. If your outside
data have merges, the various &quot;add&quot; functions may not perfectly perform. There
is no real way I can control for this since the data are coming from outside
the package and not through one of the &quot;create&quot; functions. In your particular
case, that may not be much of a problem. However, it's the user's
responsibility to do their own quality control in this situation.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>declare_attributes()</code> takes a data frame and
adds <span class="pkg">peacesciencer</span>-specific attributes to the data frame.
This will allow the user to take advantage of many of the
functions in this package without starting the process with one
of the &quot;create&quot; functions. If nothing is declared in the function,
no attribute is added and the function just returns the original
data without any change.

<h2 id='download_extdata'>Download Some Extra Data for Peace Science Research</h2><span id='topic+download_extdata'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>download_extdata()</code> leverages R's <code>inst</code> directory
flexibility to allow you to download some extra data and store it in
the package.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>download_extdata(overwrite = FALSE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr><td><code id="download_extdata_+3A_overwrite">overwrite</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical, defaults to FALSE. If FALSE, the function
checks to see if you've already downloaded the data and, if you already
have, it does nothing. If TRUE, the function redownloads the data.</p>

<h4>Chance-Corrected Measures of Foreign Policy Similarity (FPSIM, v. 2)</h4>

<p>The FPSIM data set provides measures of foreign policy similarity of dyads
based on alliance ties (Correlates of War, version 4.1) and UN General
Assembly voting (Voeten, version 17) for all members of the Correlates of
War state system. The alliance data cover the time period from 1816 to 2012,
and the UN voting data from 1946 to 2015. The similarity measures include
various versions of Ritter and Signorino's <em>S</em> (weighted/non-weighted by
material capabilities; squared/absolute distance metrics) as well as the
chance-corrected measures Cohen's (1960) kappa and Scott's (1955) pi. The
measures based on alliance data come in two versions: one is based on valued
alliance ties and the other is based on binary alliance ties. Data were
last updated on December 7, 2017, and this description was effectively
plagiarized (with his blessing) from Frank Haege's Dataverse.
</p>
<p>These data are directed dyad-years with 17 columns and 1,872,198
observations. They will almost certainly be the largest data set
I nudge/ask you to download remotely. The file containing this
information is 18.6 MB in size. To reduce size further, these
decimal points have also been rounded to three spots.
</p>
<p>Haege generated all estimates of dyadic foreign policy similarity, except
for the <code>taub</code> column. That was generated separately, by me.</p>

<h4>(Non-Directed) Dyadic Minimum Distance Data <em>Plus</em> (CoW States)</h4>

<p>These are <em>non-directed</em> dyadic minimum distance data from Schvitz et al.
(2022) for all Correlates of War states from the start of 1886 to the
end of 2019. Note that I call these &quot;data <em>plus</em>&quot;, with the idea of
informally branding these as a kind of augmentation of what you might
otherwise do with the <span class="pkg">cshapes</span> package. This data set has over
4.4 million rows for each dyadic minimum distance for all available
years. Within each year, there is a recorded minimum distance for Jan. 1,
June 30, Dec. 31 and, in addition, any day within the year where the
composition of the international system (or shape of a state) changed, as
recorded in <span class="pkg">cshapes</span>. Sometimes these changes concern the dyadic
minimum distance; sometimes they don't. For example, the League of Nations
is responsible for a lot shape changes (i.e. system entry) in the CoW state
system data in the year 1920. That obviously won't change the dyadic minimum
distance between the U.S. and Canada, which will always be zero. Sometimes the
start of the year (Jan. 1), the midpoint of the year (June 30), or the end of
the year (Dec. 31) coincides with a system change. Often it doesn't. Note that
a referent day (Jan. 1, June 30, Dec. 31) may not appear in a given year for
a given dyad if that date exists outside CoW state system membership. For
example, Canada doesn't appear as a state system member until Jan. 10, 1920.
The goal of this data set is allow you to more quickly generate dyadic
minimum distances within <span class="pkg">peacesciencer</span>'s functionality if you are
proficient in <span class="pkg">tidyverse</span> verbs. You could also use it to highlight
how often the dyadic minimum distance may vary within a year for a given
dyad.
</p>
<p>Despite the dimensions of the data set, it's not too big of a download. The
data are about 1.7 MB in size.</p>

<h4>(Non-Directed) Dyadic Minimum Distance Data <em>Plus</em> (G-W States)</h4>

<p>These are <em>non-directed</em> dyadic minimum distance data from Schvitz et al.
(2022) for all Gleditsch-Ward states from the start of 1886 to the
end of 2019. Note that I call these &quot;data <em>plus</em>&quot;, with the idea of

the Soviet Union is responsible for a lot shape changes (i.e. system entry) in
1991. That obviously won't change the dyadic minimum
distance between the U.S. and Canada, which will always be zero. Sometimes the
start of the year (Jan. 1), the midpoint of the year (June 30), or the end of

a referent day (Jan. 1, June 30, Dec. 31) may not appear in a given year for
a given dyad if that date exists outside G-W state system membership. For
example, Haiti disappears from the state system on July 4, 1915 and
reappears on Aug. 15, 1934. That means there won't be any dyadic minimum
distance observations with the U.S., for example, on Dec. 31, 1915 or June
30, 1934. The goal of this data set is allow you to more quickly generate dyadic

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This is a simple data set that communicates directed dyads in the Gleditsch-Ward data that appear in the same year,
but not in any particular day in the year. They are used in an anti-join in the <code>create_dyadyears()</code> function in this package.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame the following four variables.

<h2 id='filter_prd'>Filter dyad-year data to include just politically relevant dyads</h2><span id='topic+filter_prd'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>filter_prd()</code> filters a dyad-year data frame to just those that
are &quot;politically relevant.&quot; This is useful for discarding unnecessary (and unwanted)
observations that just consume space in memory.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>filter_prd(data)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr><td><code id="filter_prd_+3A_data">data</code></td>
<td>
<p>a dyad-year data frame (either &quot;directed&quot; or &quot;non-directed&quot;)</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>&quot;Political relevance&quot; can be calculated a few ways. Right now, the function
considers only &quot;direct&quot; contiguity and Correlates of War major power status. You can employ
maximalist definitions of &quot;direct contiguity&quot; to focus on just the land-contiguous. This function
is inclusive of any type of contiguity relationship.
</p>
<p>As of version 0.5, <code>filter_prd()</code> is a shortcut for <code>add_contiguity()</code>
and/or <code>add_cow_majors()</code> if the function is executed in the absence of the data needed to create
politically relevant dyads. See the example below for what this means.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>filter_prd()</code> takes a dyad-year data frame, assuming it has columns for
major power status and contiguity type, calculates whether the dyad is &quot;politically
relevant&quot;, and subsets the data frame to just those observations.
</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The process of creating these is described at one of the references below. Importantly, these data are somewhat
&quot;naive.&quot; That is: they won't tell you, for example, that Brazil and Japan never directly fought each other during World War II.
Instead, it will tell you that there were two years of overlap for the two on different sides of the conflict and that the highest
action for both was a war. The data are thus similar to what the <code>EUGene</code> program would create for users back in the day. Use these
data with that limitation in mind.
</p>
<p>Data were created by first selecting on unique onsets. Then, where duplicates remained: retaining highest fatality, highest hostility level,
highest estimated minimum duration, reciprocated observations over unreciprocated observations, and, finally, the lowest start month.
</p>
<p>Be mindful that Archigos' leader data are nominally denominated in Gleditsch-Ward states, which are standardized to Correlates of War
state system membership as well as the data can allow. There will be some missing leaders after 1870 because Archigos is ultimately its
own system.

<p>These data are purposely light on information; they're not intended to be used for dispute-level analyses, per se.
They're intended to augment the directed dyadic dispute-year data by adding in variables that serve as exclusion rules to whittle
the data from dyadic dispute-year to just dyad-year data.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Information about leaders come from Archigos (v. 4.1). GML MID Data are version 2.2.1. The <code>data-raw</code> directory
contains information about how these data were generated. There is invariably going to be some guesswork here because
dates are sometimes not known with precision. Sometimes, a dispute coincides even with a leadership change when dates are
known with precision. The source script includes a discussion of these cases and shows how the data were generated with all
these caveats in mind.
</p>
<p>Do note that participants can have several episodes within a dispute. Sometimes participants switch sides (e.g. Romania in World War 2).
Sometime participants drop in and out of a long-running dispute (e.g. Syria, prominently, in MID#4182).
</p>
<p>&quot;Dummy&quot; start days and end days are there to serve as a parlor trick in assigning disputes to leaders in leader-level analyses. Where days
are known with precision, the dummy day is that number. In most cases, where the day is not known with precision coincides with a month
that has no leader transition. Thus, the start day that gets imputed is going to be the first of the month (for the dummy start day)
or the last of the month (for the dummy end day). Cases where there was a leader transition (or two) that month may require some more
sensitive imputing. For example, our best guess is Antonio Guzmán Blanco of Venezuela is president for the end of MID#1639, given his
role in trying to negotiate a conclusion to the dispute. Archigos has him leaving office on the 7th, so that's the end day that gets imputed
for him. Again, these are here to serve as a parlor trick in assigning disputes to leaders for leader-level analyses. Be careful about using
these data for calculating dispute-participant duration. In fact: don't do that.

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This is a complete list of capitals and capital transitions for Gleditsch-Ward state system members. I
use it internally for calculating capital-to-capital distances in the <code>add_capital_distances()</code> function.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>gw_capitals
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 248 observations on the following 7 variables.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>gwcode</code></dt><dd><p>a numeric vector for the Gleditsch-Ward state code</p>
</dd>

</dd>
<dt><code>lng</code></dt><dd><p>a numeric vector of the longitude coordinates for the capital</p>
</dd>
</dl>



<h3>Details</h3>

<p>For convenience, the start year for most states is 1816. Samoa, for example, was not a state
in 1816. However, the functions that use the <code>gw_capitals</code> data will not create observations for states
that did not exist at a given point in time.
</p>
<p>The data should be current as of the end of 2020.
</p>
<p>Cases where a start year is not 1816 indicate a capital transition. For example, Brazil's capital moved from
Rio de Janeiro to Brasilia (a planned capital) in 1960. Only 25 states in the data experienced a capital transition.
The most recent was Burundi in 2018. Indonesia, as of writing, is planning on a capital transition, but this has not
been completed yet.
</p>
<p>Kazakhstan renamed its capital for the state leader in 2019. These data retain the name of Astana. This will be changed
in the event the software I use records this change.
</p>
<p>The capitals data are not without some peculiarities. Prominently, Portugal transferred the Portuguese court from
Lisbon to Rio de Janeiro from 1808 to 1821. <em>This is recorded in the data.</em> A knowledge of the inter-state conflict data
will note there was no war or dispute between, say, Portugal and Spain (or Portugal and any other country) at any point
during this time, but it does create some weirdness that would suggest a massive distance between two countries, like
Portugal and Spain, that are otherwise land-contiguous.
</p>
<p>On Spain: the republican government moved the capital at the start of the civil war (in 1936) to Valencia. However, it
abandoned this capital by 1937. I elect to not record this capital transition.
</p>
<p>On Myanmar: the Gleditsch-Ward system stands out as having Myanmar entered for the bulk of the 19th century. The capitals
recorded for Myanmar (Burma) coincide with capitals of the Konbaung dynasty.
</p>
<p>The data also do some (I think) reasonable back-dating of capitals to coincide with states in transition without
necessarily formal capitals by the first appearance in the state system membership data. These concern Lithuania,
Kazakhstan, and the Philippines. Kaunas is the initial post-independence capital of Lithuania. Almaty is the initial
post-independence capital of Kazakhstan. Quezon City is the initial post-independence capital of the Philippines.
This concerns, at the most, one or two years for each of these three countries.

</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The <code>data-raw</code> directory on the project's Github contains more information about how these data were
created. I'm going to use it for internal stuff. The workflow is going to treat the Gleditsch-Ward state system
membership codes as more of the &quot;master&quot; codes, for which the user can add Correlates of War identifiers as they see
fit. Data are extended to 2020, assuming no changes to state system membership for either data set.

<h2 id='gw_mindist'>The Minimum Distance Between States in the Gleditsch-Ward System, 1886-2019</h2><span id='topic+gw_mindist'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>These are non-directed dyad-year data for the minimum distance between states in the Gleditsch-Ward state system from
1886 to 2018. The data are generated from the <span class="pkg">cshapes</span> package.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>gw_mindist
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 868813 observations on the following 4 variables.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>gwcode1</code></dt><dd><p>the Gleditsch-Ward state system code for the first state</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>gwcode2</code></dt><dd><p>the Gleditsch-Ward state system code for the second state</p>

<dt><code>year</code></dt><dd><p>the year</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>mindist</code></dt><dd><p>the minimum distance between states on Jan. 1 of the year, in kilometers</p>
</dd>
</dl>



<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The data are generated from the <span class="pkg">cshapes</span> package. The package authors purport that the data
are generated to be compatible with the Gleditsch-Ward system. I trust them on this; indeed, Gleditsch is one of the
authors of the <span class="pkg">cshapes</span> package.
</p>
<p>Data are automatically generated (by default) as directed dyad-years. I elect to make them non-directed for space
considerations. Making non-directed dyad-year data into directed dyad-year data isn't too difficult in R. It just
looks weird to see the code that does it.
</p>
<p>Previous versions of these data were for the minimum distance as of Dec. 31 of the referent year. These are now Jan. 1.
Most of the data I prove elsewhere in this package are  to be understood as the data as they were at the <em>start</em> of
the year. This is how I process, for example, the <code>capitals</code> data as they get merged in the <code>add_capital_distance()</code>
function. However, the script that generates these data are set at Jan. 1 of the year and not Dec. 31. Right now, the <span class="pkg">cshapes</span>
does not appear to work on my system and I do not know why. Fortunately, the package authors made these data available.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>These were provided by Anders on a separate Github repository for this project. Because these
data are ultimately being simulated, a user can expect some slight differences between the Correlates of War version of these data
(which Anders et al. published) and the Gleditsch-Ward version of these data (which appear to be the one the authors will more
vigorously support going forward).
</p>
<p>Space considerations compel me to round these data to three decimal points.  These &quot;economic&quot; data are routinely
the biggest in the package, and it's because of the decimal points. The justification for this is these data are estimated/simulated
anyways and the information loss is at the 1/1000th decimal point. This procedure basically cuts the size of the data to be less than
25% of its original size. The original simulations are available for remote download if you'd like. Type <code>?download_extdata()</code> for
more information.

&quot;Wuerttemberg&quot; and &quot;Cote D'Ivoire&quot; in the <code>statename</code> column needed to be
renamed to ensure maximal compliance with CRAN, which raises notes for
every non-ASCII character that appears in its package. I do not think this
to be problematic at all and, after all, state names should never be
a basis for something like a match or merge you would do in

<h2 id='leader_codes'>A Data Set of Leader Codes Across Archigos 4.1, Archigos 2.9, and the LEAD Data</h2><span id='topic+leader_codes'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This is a simple data set that matches, as well as one can, leader codes across Archigos 4.1, Archigos 2.9, and the LEAD data set.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>leader_codes
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame the following four variables.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>obsid</code></dt><dd><p>the observation ID in the Archigos data</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>leadid</code></dt><dd><p>the leader ID in version 4.1 of the Archigos data</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>leadid29</code></dt><dd><p>the leader ID in version 2.9 of the Archigos data</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>leaderid</code></dt><dd><p>the leader ID in the LEAD data</p>
</dd>
</dl>



<h3>Details</h3>

<p>These data treat version 4.1 of the Archigos data as the gospel leader data (if you will) for which  the observation ID (<code>obsid</code>)
is the master code indicating a leader tenure period. It also builds in an assumption that various observations that duplicate in the
LEAD data should not have duplicated. This concerns Francisco Aguilar Barquer (who appears twice), Emile Reuter (who appears twice),
and Gunnar Thoroddsen (who appears three times) in the LEAD data despite having uninterrupted tenures in office. None of the covariates
associated with these leaders change in the LEAD data, which is why I assume they were duplicates.

</dd>
</dl>



<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The letter published by the authors contains more information as to what these thetas refer.
The &quot;M1&quot; theta is a variation of the standard Rasch model from the boilerplate information in the LEAD
data. The authors consider this to be &quot;theoretically relevant&quot; or &quot;risk-related&quot; as these all refer to conflict
or risk-taking. The &quot;M2&quot; theta expands on &quot;M1&quot; by including political orientation and psychological characteristics.
&quot;M3&quot; and &quot;M4&quot; expand on &quot;M1&quot; and &quot;M2&quot; by considering all 36 variables in the LEAD data.
</p>
<p>The authors construct and include all these measures, though their analyses suggest &quot;M2&quot; is the best-performing measure.

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>These are Zeev Maoz' data for what states are regional or global powers at a given point time. They are
extensions of the Correlates of War major power data, which only codes &quot;major&quot; power without consideration
of regional or global distinctions. Think of Austria-Hungary as intuitive of the issue here. Austria-Hungary
is a major power in the Correlates of War data, but there is good reason to treat Austria-Hungary as a major
power only within Europe. That is what Zeev Maoz tries to do here.

<h2 id='ps_cite'>Get <code>BibTeX</code> Entries Associated with <span class="pkg">peacesciencer</span> Data and Functions</h2><span id='topic+ps_cite'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>ps_cite()</code> allows the user to get citations to scholarship that they
should include in their papers that incorporate the functions and data in this package.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>ps_cite(x, column = "keywords")
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr><td><code id="ps_cite_+3A_x">x</code></td>
<td>
<p>a character vector</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="ps_cite_+3A_column">column</code></td>
<td>
<p>a character vector for the particular column of <code>ps_bib</code> the user wants to search. The default here is <code>"keywords"</code>,
which searches the <code>KEYWORDS</code> column in <code>ps_bib</code> for the most general search. The other option is <code>"bibtexkey"</code>, which will
search the <code>BIBTEXKEY</code> column in <code>ps_bib</code>. Use the latter option more for pairing with output from <code>ps_version()</code></p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The base functionality here is simple pattern-matching on keywords in <code>ps_bib</code>. This
simple pattern-matching is in base R. I assume the user has some familiarity with <code>BibTeX</code>.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>ps_cite()</code> takes a character vector and scans the <code>ps_bib</code> data in
this package to return a <code>BibTeX</code> citation (or citations) for the researcher to use
to properly cite the material they are getting from this package. The citations
are returned as a full <code>BibTeX</code> entry (or entries) that they can copy-paste into their
own <code>BibTeX</code> file.

<h2 id='ps_data_version'>The Version Numbers for Data Included in <span class="pkg">peacesciencer</span></h2><span id='topic+ps_data_version'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This is a simple data set that communicates the version numbers of data included in this package. It's a companion
to the data frame <code>ps_bib</code>, and other information functions like <code>ps_cite()</code> and <code>ps_version()</code>. The latter
uses this data set.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>ps_data_version
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame the following four variables.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>category</code></dt><dd><p>a category for the type of data</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>data</code></dt><dd><p>the name of the particular data source coinciding with the category</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>version</code></dt><dd><p>the version number included in <span class="pkg">peacesciencer</span> for this data source</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>bibtexkey</code></dt><dd><p>a character key for the <code>BibTeX</code> key corresponding with an appropriate citation in <code>ps_bib</code></p>
</dd>
</dl>



<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Version numbers that are years should be understood as data sources with no formal version numbering system, per se. Instead,
they communicate a year of last update. For example, the Correlates of War does not formally version number its state system data
as it does its MID data. Likewise, the Anders et al. (2020) simulations of population and surplus/gross domestic product are not formally
versioned, per se. Instead, the data were published and last updated in 2020.

<hr>
<h2 id='ps_version'>Get Version Information About Data Included in <span class="pkg">peacesciencer</span></h2><span id='topic+ps_version'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>ps_version()</code> allows the user to see version information
about data included in <span class="pkg">peacesciencer</span>.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>ps_version(cat)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr><td><code id="ps_version_+3A_cat">cat</code></td>
<td>
<p>a category of data type the user wants, as a character</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The base functionality here is simple pattern-matching on keywords
in <code>ps_data_version</code>. This simple pattern-matching is in base R. I
assume the user has some familiarity with the types of data included in
this package.
</p>
<p>The searching is done by category included in the <code>ps_data_version</code> data.
Users may want to just minimally run <code>ps_version()</code> with no argument
specified to see for themselves what's in it. Typing
<code>unique(ps_data_version$category)</code> may also get them started.
</p>
<p>The user can consider this a companion function to <code>ps_cite()</code>.
Whereas <code>ps_cite()</code> will return the appropriate citation
to use in the bibliography, it may not tell them the version number at all.
For example, the classic and suggested citations for the Correlates of War
National Material Capabilities data are too Singer et al. (1972) and Singer
(1987), though the data included in this package are about 30 years older
than the most recent citation of the two.
</p>
<p>The information communicated here can/should be included alongside a
parenthetical citation. For example, the contiguity data are
quite a bit more current than the suggested citation to Stinnett et al.
(2002). Thus, a user may want to cite the data in their paper
as something like (Stinnett et al. 2002, v. 3.2).
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>ps_version()</code> takes a character vector and scans the
<code>ps_data_version</code> data in this package to return information about
the particular data versions included in <span class="pkg">peacesciencer</span> as well as a
suggested citation key for scanning <code>ps_cite()</code>. If no category is
specified for searching, it just returns all version information for
all data included in functions in this package.

</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>rugged

<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 192 observations on the following 6 variables.

</dd>
</dl>



<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The <code>data-raw</code> directory on the project's Github contains more information about how these data were
created. It goes without saying that these data move <em>slowly</em> so the data are really only applicable for making state-to-state
comparisons and not states-in-time comparisons. The terrain ruggedness index is originally introduced by Riley et al. (1999) but
is amended by Nunn and Puga (2012). The mountain terrain data was originally created by Fearon and Laitin (2003) but extended and
amended by Gibler and Miller (2014). The data are functionally time-agnostic&mdash;use with caution in your state-year analyses&mdash;but all
data sets seem to benchmark around 1999-2000. I'm not sure it matters  <em>that</em> much, but it matters a little at the margins, I suppose,
if you suspect there are major differences in interpretation of how much more &quot;rugged&quot; the Soviet Union was than Russia, or Yugoslavia
than Serbia.

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>show_duplicates()</code> shows which data are duplicated
in data generated in <span class="pkg">peacesciencer</span>. It's a useful diagnostic tool
for users doing some do-it-yourself functions with <span class="pkg">peacesciencer</span>.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>show_duplicates(data)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<td>
<p>a dyad-year data frame or a state-year data frame created in <span class="pkg">peacesciencer</span>.</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The function leans on attributes of the data that are
provided by the <code>create_dyadyear()</code> or <code>create_stateyear()</code>
function. Make sure that function (or data created by that function)
appear at the top of the proverbial pipe.
</p>
<p>The data returned will also have a new column called <code>duplicated</code>.
Thus, an implicit assumption in this function is the user does not have
a column in the data with this name that is of interest to the user.
It will be overwritten.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>show_duplicates()</code> takes a dyad-year data frame or
state-year data frame generated in <span class="pkg">peacesciencer</span> and
shows what observations are duplicated by unique combination of
dyad-year or state-year, contingent on what was supplied to it.

<p>Information gathered from chapter 2 of Thompson et al. (2021).
Ongoing rivalries are right-bound at 2020. In several cases, start dates
of 1494 and 1816 originally had a &quot;P&quot; attached to them, indicating they
were ongoing before that particular year. This is captured in the &quot;raw&quot;
spreadsheet included in the &quot;data-raw&quot; directory, though this is adjusted
in this finished data product.
</p>
<p>This file adjusts for what is assuredly two print errors in Thompson et al.
(2021). In print, Thompson et al. (2021) say the Italy-Turkey rivalry
extends from 1884-1843 and say the Mauritania-Morocco rivalry extends
from 1060-1969. They had meant an end year of 1943 in the first case and
a start year of 1960 in the second case. This is fixed in this version.
</p>
<p>Venice never appears in any data set in the Correlates of War ecosystem
of data, but I gave it a country code of 324 for the sake of these data
(and the previous Thompson and Dreyer (2012) version of it). You'll never
use this, but it's worth saying out loud that's what I did.
</p>
<p>Thompson et al. (2021) dedicate their book to expanding on the various
types of rivalry. Users who know the Thompson and Dreyer (2012) version
will see a few differences here. First, rivalries no longer have formal
primary, secondary, or tertiary types. Instead, rivalries have
there/not there markers for whether a particular element of a rivalry type
is present in the rivalry. From what I've read so far of Thompson et al.
(2021), along with their ordering of the information in Chapter 2, it reads
like they've just made informal what was otherwise a more formal classification
component to the Thompson and Dreyer (2012) rivalry data. Positional rivalries
seem to be an informal &quot;type 1&quot; as Thompson et al. (2021) discuss it, not
at all dissimilar to how the classic alliance scholarship treats defense as
a &quot;type 1&quot; pledge. No matter, this book is already more explicit that
positional and spatial rivalries are clearly different from ideological
and interventionary rivalries, and certainly the interventionary rivalries.
</p>
<p>&quot;Principal&quot; and &quot;asymmetric principal&quot; rivalries are a new classification in
Thompson et al. (2021), relative to Thompson and Dreyer (2012). &quot;Principal&quot;
rivalries exist where 1) the two rivals have no other rivalry or 2) the two
rivals elevate this rivalry as their primary rivalry among other rivalries.
Asymmetric principal rivalries are when only one of the two rivals sees the
other as its primary rival. Consider two U.S.-Russian rivalries as
illustrative. Tge rivalry with the Soviet Union (<code>tssr_id = 100</code>) was
the primary rivalry for the U.S. (and the Soviet Union). However, the U.S.
presently sees China as its main rival (<code>tssr_id = 211</code>). The ongoing
rivalry with Russia (<code>tssr_id = 246</code>) is one where Russia sees the U.S.
as its primary rival but the U.S. does not see Russia the same way.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The user will want to note that the data provided by UCDP are technically not country-year observations. They instead duplicate observations for cases of new conflicts
or new conflict episodes. Further, the original data do not provide any information about the conflict-dyad in question to which those duplicates pertain. That means the most
these data can do for the package's mission is provide summary information. The user should probably recode these variables into something else they may want for a
particular application

<h2 id='whittle_conflicts_duration'>Whittle Duplicate Conflict-Years by Conflict Duration</h2><span id='topic+whittle_conflicts_duration'></span><span id='topic+wc_duration'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>whittle_conflicts_duration()</code> is in a class of
do-it-yourself functions for coercing (i.e. &quot;whittling&quot;) conflict-year
data with cross-sectional units to unique conflict-year data by
cross-sectional unit. The inspiration here is clearly the problem
of whittling dyadic dispute-year data into true dyad-year data (like in
the Gibler-Miller-Little conflict data). This particular function will
keep the observations with the highest estimated duration.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>whittle_conflicts_duration(data, durtype = "mindur")

wc_duration(...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr><td><code id="whittle_conflicts_duration_+3A_data">data</code></td>
<td>
<p>a data frame with a declared conflict attribute type.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="whittle_conflicts_duration_+3A_durtype">durtype</code></td>
<td>
<p>a duration on which to filter/whittle the data. Options include <code>"mindur"</code> or  <code>"maxdur"</code>. The default is  <code>"mindur"</code>.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="whittle_conflicts_duration_+3A_...">...</code></td>
<td>
<p>optional, only to make the shortcut work</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Dyads are capable of having multiple disputes in a given year,
which can create a problem for merging into a complete dyad-year
data frame. Consider the case of France and Italy in 1860, which
had three separate dispute onsets that year (MID#0112, MID#0113, MID#0306),
as illustrative of the problem. The default process in <span class="pkg">peacesciencer</span>
employs several rules to whittle down these duplicate dyad-years for
merging into a dyad-year data frame. These are available in
<code>add_cow_mids()</code> and <code>add_gml_mids()</code>.
</p>
<p>Some conflicts can be of an unknown length and often come with estimates
of a minimum duration and a maximum duration. This will concern the
<code>durtype</code> parameter in this function. In many/most conflicts,
certainly thinking of the inter-state dispute data, dates are known with
precision (to the day) and the estimate of minimum conflict duration is
equal to the estimate of maximum conflict duration. For some conflicts,
the estimates will vary. This does importantly imply that using this
particular whittle function with the default (<code>mindur</code>) will produce
different results than using this particular whittle function and asking
to retain the highest maximum duration (<code>maxdur</code>). Use the function
with that in mind.
</p>
<p><code>wc_duration()</code> is a simple, less wordy, shortcut for the same function.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>whittle_conflicts_duration()</code> takes a dyad-year data frame
or leader-dyad-year data frame  with a declared conflict attribute type
and, grouping by the dyad and year, returns just those observations that
have the highest observed dispute-level fatality. This will not eliminate
all duplicates, far from it, but it's a sensible cut later into the
procedure (after whittling onsets in <code>whittle_conflicts_onsets(),
and maybe some other things</code> the extent to which dispute-level duration
is a heuristic for dispute-level severity/importance.

<p>As of writing, the Correlates of War and Gibler-Miller-Little conflict
data record some -9s for fatalities. In those cases, dispute-level
fatality is momentarily recoded to be .5 (i.e. fatal, but without too
many fatalities). This is a missing data problem that Gibler and Miller
correct in a forthcoming publication in <em>Journal of Conflict Resolution</em>.
Until then, this function makes that kind of determination about
disputes with missing fatalities.

do-it-yourself functions for coercing (i.e. &quot;whittling&quot;) conflict-year
data with cross-sectional units to unique conflict-year data by
cross-sectional unit. The inspiration here is clearly the problem
of whittling dyadic dispute-year data into true dyad-year data (like in
the Gibler-Miller-Little conflict data). This particular function will
keep the observations that are reciprocated (i.e. have militarized actions
on both sides of the conflict).

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>whittle_conflicts_reciprocation(data)

wc_recip(...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr><td><code id="whittle_conflicts_reciprocation_+3A_data">data</code></td>
<td>
<p>a data frame with a declared conflict attribute type.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="whittle_conflicts_reciprocation_+3A_...">...</code></td>
<td>
<p>optional, only to make the shortcut work</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Dyads are capable of having multiple disputes in a given year,
which can create a problem for merging into a complete dyad-year
data frame. Consider the case of France and Italy in 1860, which
had three separate dispute onsets that year (MID#0112, MID#0113, MID#0306),
as illustrative of the problem. The default process in <span class="pkg">peacesciencer</span>
employs several rules to whittle down these duplicate dyad-years for
merging into a dyad-year data frame. These are available in
<code>add_cow_mids()</code> and <code>add_gml_mids()</code>.
</p>
<p>Scholars are free to use this as a heuristic for whittling conflict-year
data to be coerced into true dyad-year data, but I would be remiss if I
did not offer a caveat about the reciprocation variable in inter-state
dispute data. Namely, it is noisy and is not doing what scholars often
think it's doing in the inter-state dispute data. Reciprocation is observed
only when there is a militarized action on both sides of the conflict.
By definition, someone on Side A will have a militarized action. Not every
state on Side B does. However, scholars should <em>not</em> interpret that as
the absence of militarized responses. In a forthcoming article in
<em>Journal of Conflict Resolution</em>, Doug Gibler and I make the case that
reciprocation isn't a useful variable to maintain at all because it
can only invite errors (as is often the case in the CoW-MID data) and
will obscure the fact that states that are attacked by another side
routinely fight back. On many occasions, they also successfully repel
the attack. Scholars who uncritically use this variable, certainly for
hypothesis-testing on audience costs, are borrowing trouble with
this measure.
</p>
<p><code>wc_recip()</code> is a simple, less wordy, shortcut for the same function.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>whittle_conflicts_reciprocation()</code> takes a dyad-year data
frame or leader-dyad-year data frame with a declared conflict attribute
type and, grouping by the dyad and year, returns just those observations
that have militarized actions on both sides of the conflict. This will not
eliminate all duplicates, far from it, but it's a sensible cut later into
the procedure (after whittling onsets in <code>whittle_conflicts_onsets()</code>
the extent to which dispute-level reciprocation is a heuristic for
dispute-level severity/importance (after some other considerations).

<p>This really should be one of the last exclusion rules a researcher uses.
There is no substantive reason to assume the lower start month matters
for the cause of isolating &quot;serious&quot; or &quot;severe&quot; disputes in the presence
of duplicates. It's really just a way of isolating which duplicated
observation happened first where remaining duplicates are otherwise
very similar to each other.
