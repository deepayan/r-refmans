<h2 id='emfx'>Post-estimation treatment effects for an ETWFE regressions.</h2><span id='topic+emfx'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Post-estimation treatment effects for an ETWFE regressions.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>emfx(
  object,
  type = c("simple", "group", "calendar", "event"),
  by_xvar = "auto",
  collapse = "auto",
  post_only = TRUE,
  ...
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr><td><code id="emfx_+3A_object">object</code></td>
<td>
<p>An <code>etwfe</code> model object.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="emfx_+3A_type">type</code></td>
<td>
<p>Character. The desired type of post-estimation aggregation.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="emfx_+3A_by_xvar">by_xvar</code></td>
<td>
<p>Logical. Should the results account for heterogeneous
treatment effects? Only relevant if the preceding <code>etwfe</code> call included a
specified <code>xvar</code> argument, i.e. interacted categorical covariate. The
default behaviour (&quot;auto&quot;) is to automatically estimate heterogeneous
treatment effects for each level of <code>xvar</code> if these are detected as part
of the underlying <code>etwfe</code> model object. Users can override by setting to
either FALSE or TRUE. See the section on Heterogeneous treatment effects
below.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="emfx_+3A_collapse">collapse</code></td>
<td>
<p>Logical. Collapse the data by (period by cohort) groups
before calculating marginal effects? This trades off a loss in estimate
accuracy (typically around the 1st or 2nd significant decimal point) for a
substantial improvement in estimation time for large datasets. The default
behaviour (&quot;auto&quot;) is to automatically collapse if the original dataset
has more than 500,000 rows. Users can override by setting either FALSE or
TRUE. Note that collapsing by group is only valid if the preceding <code>etwfe</code>
call was run with &quot;ivar = NULL&quot; (the default). See the section on
Performance tips below.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="emfx_+3A_post_only">post_only</code></td>
<td>
<p>Logical. Drop pre-treatment ATTs? Only evaluated if (a)
<code>type = "event"</code> and (b) the original <code>etwfe</code> model object was estimated
using the default &quot;notyet&quot; treated control group. If conditions (a) and
(b) are met then the pre-treatment effects will be zero as a mechanical
result of ETWFE's estimation setup. The default behaviour (<code>FALSE</code>) is
thus to drop these nuisance rows from the dataset. The <code>post_only</code> argument
recognises that you may still want to keep them for presentation purposes
(e.g., plotting an event-study). Nevertheless, be forewarned that enabling
that behaviour via <code>TRUE</code> is <em>strictly</em> performative: the &quot;zero&quot; treatment
effects for any pre-treatment periods is purely an artefact of the
estimation setup.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="emfx_+3A_...">...</code></td>
<td>
<p>Additional arguments passed to
<code><a href="marginaleffects.html#topic+slopes">marginaleffects::slopes</a></code>. For example, you can pass <code>vcov = FALSE</code> to dramatically speed up estimation times of the main marginal
effects (but at the cost of not getting any information about standard
errors; see Performance tips below). Another potentially useful
application is testing whether heterogeneous treatment effects (i.e. the
levels of any <code>xvar</code> covariate) are equal by invoking the <code>hypothesis</code>
argument, e.g. <code>hypothesis = "b1 = b2"</code>.</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A <code>slopes</code> object from the <code>marginaleffects</code> package.
</p>


<h3>Performance tips</h3>

<p>Under most situations, <code>etwfe</code> should complete very quickly. For its part,
<code>emfx</code> is quite performant too and should take a few seconds or less for
datasets under 100k rows. However, <code>emfx</code>'s computation time does tend to
scale non-linearly with the size of the original data, as well as the
number of interactions from the underlying <code>etwfe</code> model. Without getting
too deep into the weeds, the numerical delta method used to recover the
ATEs of interest has to estimate two prediction models for <em>each</em>
coefficient in the model and then compute their standard errors. So, it's
a potentially expensive operation that can push the computation time for
large datasets (&gt; 1m rows) up to several minutes or longer.
</p>
<p>Fortunately, there are two complementary strategies that you can use to
speed things up. The first is to turn off the most expensive part of the
whole procedure&mdash;standard error calculation&mdash;by calling <code>emfx(..., vcov = FALSE)</code>. Doing so should bring the estimation time back down to a few
seconds or less, even for datasets in excess of a million rows. While the
loss of standard errors might not be an acceptable trade-off for projects
where statistical inference is critical, the good news is this first
strategy can still be combined our second strategy. It turns out that
collapsing the data by groups prior to estimating the marginal effects can
yield substantial speed gains of its own. Users can do this by invoking
the <code>emfx(..., collapse = TRUE)</code> argument. While the effect here is not as
dramatic as the first strategy, our second strategy does have the virtue
of retaining information about the standard errors. The trade-off this
time, however, is that collapsing our data does lead to a loss in accuracy
for our estimated parameters. On the other hand, testing suggests that
this loss in accuracy tends to be relatively minor, with results
equivalent up to the 1st or 2nd significant decimal place (or even
better).
</p>
<p>Summarizing, here's a quick plan of attack for you to try if you are
worried about the estimation time for large datasets and models:
</p>

<ol>
<li><p> Estimate <code>mod = etwfe(...)</code> as per usual.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Run <code>emfx(mod, vcov = FALSE, ...)</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Run <code>emfx(mod, vcov = FALSE, collapse = TRUE, ...)</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Compare the point estimates from steps 1 and 2. If they are are similar
enough to your satisfaction, get the approximate standard errors by
running <code>emfx(mod, collapse = TRUE, ...)</code>.
</p>
</li></ol>



<h3>Heterogeneous treatment effects</h3>

<p>Specifying <code style="white-space: pre;">&#8288;etwfe(..., xvar = &lt;xvar&gt;)&#8288;</code> will generate interaction effects
for all levels of <code style="white-space: pre;">&#8288;&lt;xvar&gt;&#8288;</code> as part of the main regression model. The
reason that this is useful (as opposed to a regular, non-interacted
covariate in the formula RHS) is that it allows us to estimate
heterogeneous treatment effects as part of the larger ETWFE framework.
Specifically, we can recover heterogeneous treatment effects for each
level of <code style="white-space: pre;">&#8288;&lt;xvar&gt;&#8288;</code> by passing the resulting <code>etwfe</code> model object on to
<code>emfx()</code>.
</p>
<p>For example, imagine that we have a categorical variable called &quot;age&quot; in
our dataset, with two distinct levels &quot;adult&quot; and &quot;child&quot;. Running
<code>emfx(etwfe(..., xvar = age))</code> will tell us how the efficacy of treatment
varies across adults and children. We can then also leverage the in-built
hypothesis testing infrastructure of <code>marginaleffects</code> to test whether
the treatment effect is statistically different across these two age
groups; see Examples below. Note the same principles carry over to
categorical variables with multiple levels, or even continuous variables
(although continuous variables are not as well supported yet).
