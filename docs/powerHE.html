<td>Description:</td>
<td>Calculate sample size or power for hierarchical endpoints. 
  The package can handle any type of outcomes (binary, continuous, count, ordinal, 
  time-to-event) and any number of such endpoints. It allows users to calculate 
  sample size with a given power or to calculate power with a given sample size 
  for hypothesis testing based on win ratios, win odds, net benefit, or DOOR 
  (desirability of outcome ranking) as treatment effect between two groups for 
  hierarchical endpoints. The methods of this package are described further in 
  the paper by Barnhart, H. X. et al. (2024, &lt;<a href="https://doi.org/10.1080%2F19466315.2024.2365629">doi:10.1080/19466315.2024.2365629</a>&gt;).</td>

<h2 id='formatHE'>Format powerHE Results</h2><span id='topic+formatHE'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function formats the results outputted from the powerHE function. See below (pdf) or use ?powerHE (in R) to view its documentation.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>formatHE(result)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table role = "presentation">
<tr><td><code id="formatHE_+3A_result">result</code></td>
<td>
<p>A list (return object of powerHE).</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A data frame containing the information from parameter 'result' with columns &quot;Label&quot; and &quot;Value&quot;.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'># Example TTE endpoint with formatting:

endpoints_input &lt;- list(
  list(type = "TTE",
       hr = 0.8,
       er.b = 0.25,
       s = 12,

<hr>
<h2 id='powerHE'>Hierarchical Endpoints</h2><span id='topic+powerHE'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function can calculate sample size given power or vice versa based on
inputs which represent the marginals of each endpoint. The function assumes
that the correlation between endpoints are 0, and it can output the following
probabilities: marginal and overall probability of ties, marginal and overall
WR (win ratios), marginal and overall WO (win odds), marginal and overall NB
(net benefits), marginal and overall DOOR (desirability of outcome ranking).
If given power, the function can calculate sample size for WR, WO, NB, and
DOOR. If given sample size, the function can calculate power for WR, WO, NB,
and DOOR. It is suggested to assign the output to an object, which defaults
to showing all the probabilities listed above.
Examples are given below.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>powerHE(
  endpoints_input,
  sample.size = NA,
  power = NA,
  alpha = 0.05,
  rratio = 0.5,
  output = "ALL"
