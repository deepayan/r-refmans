<h3>Description</h3>

<p><img src="../help/figures/logo.png" style='float: right' alt='logo' width='120' />
</p>
<p>Spectral emission data for some frequently used light emitting diodes available as electronic components. Part of the 'r4photobiology' suite, Aphalo P. J. (2015) <a href="https://doi.org/10.19232/uv4pb.2015.1.14">doi:10.19232/uv4pb.2015.1.14</a>.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Data for emission spectra of different types of LEDs and LED arrays.
</p>
<p>The package contains one main collection of spectra for different LEDs
available as electronic components through hole (th), surface mount devices
(SMD) and chip-on-board (COB) packages with no built-in driver circuitry to
limit the current, <code><a href="#topic+leds.mspct">leds.mspct</a></code>. Data for LED bulbs and LED
luminaires/lamps are included in package
<code><a href="photobiologyLamps.html#topic+photobiologyLamps-package">photobiologyLamps-package</a></code>. Two smaller
collections, provide spectra for a COB LED driven with varying current or
constant-current (CC) dimming, <code><a href="#topic+COB_dimming.mspct">COB_dimming.mspct</a></code>, and at fixed
current but in combination with different reflectors,
<code><a href="#topic+COB_reflectors.mspct">COB_reflectors.mspct</a></code>.
</p>
<p>In addition to the spectra the package provides character vectors of names to
be used as indexes to subset groups of spectra from <code>leds.mspct</code>. In all
cases spectral data are normalized to spectral energy irradiance equal to one
at the wavelength of maximum spectral energy irradiance (strongest emission
peak). In most cases the multiplier used for normalization can be obtained by
quering the object. However, this is useful only in those cases where the
distance from source to entrance optics of the spectrometer and alignment
were recorded.
</p>
<p>All LEDs have been measured at room temperature mounted on passive heatsinks
and usually driven near their maximum current rating. Precision power
supplies or LED drivers were used to drive them at constant current.
</p>
<p>The number of different LED types available is enormous, and this collection
attempts only to provide examples for some of them. Which types are included
is the result of what has been bought for specific uses at my lab or out of
curiosity since 1995 to the present. Which brands and LED types are included,
should not be interpreted as endorsement of any supplier.
</p>


<h3>Warning!</h3>

<p>None of the spectral data included in this package are
based on supplier's specifications and are only for information. The exact
emission spectrum of a LED depends to some extent on testing conditions,
but more importantly among individual LED dies. Spectral specifications are
usually given by typical and boundary values. Furthermore, most
manufacturers classify LEDs of a given type into &quot;bins&quot; with slightly
different colour and electrical characteristics. In addition, the
performance of LEDs deteriorates with use, with light output decreasing
faster if driven with high current or if they overheat as a consequence of
insufficient cooling. <strong>In other words, the data provided here are not
a substitute for actual measurements of radiation emission and spectrum of
the LEDs actually used in a given piece of scientific research or other
important work.</strong> For less demanding situations, such as planning of
experiments or testing the sanity of independent measurements, the data are
in most cases reliable enough but perfect agreement with measurements on
other LEDs of the same exact type should not be expected.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>Some of the LEDs were bought from AliExpress sellers while others were
sourced from major electronic component distributors like Farnell, RS
components, Digi-Key, Mouser, TME, Roithner-Lasertechnik, and Lumitronix/LedRise. In the case of some AliExpress
sellers or smaller webstores sometimes the exact type specifications are
not available. Some of the Chinese sellers package the LEDs they sell using
LED dies (= chips) from major brands and provide this brand name. In very
recent times this seems to have expanded in some cases to include high
density COB packages. Be aware that in recent times the word COB is being
used by AliExpress, Bangood and eBay sellers to describe old-style arrays
where the LED chips are not directly attached to a board to maximize 
thermal conductance. In this package, we use COB in its more restricted
meaning and name other packages simply LED array.

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A collection of emission spectra of a light-emitting-diode
driven at different constant current.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>COB_dimming.mspct

COB_dimming.tb
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A <code>"source_mspct"</code> object containing 8
<code>"source_spct"</code> objects.
</p>
<p>In each of the member spectra, the variables are as follows:
</p>

<ul>
<li><p> w.length (nm)  
</p>
</li>
<li><p> s.e.irrad (W m-2 nm-1)
</p>
</li></ul>

<p>An object of class <code>tbl_df</code> (inherits from <code>tbl</code>, <code>data.frame</code>) with 8 rows and 6 columns.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The <code>"COB_dimming.mspct"</code> object contains <code>"source_spct"</code>
objects with spectral irradiance data with the same Optisolis COB LED from
Nichia driven at different values of constant current. Distance from LED to
cosine diffuser was 159 mm; a reflector was attached to the LED to make the
light beam narrower. Spectra are not normalized. The position for
the LED with respect to the entrace optics did not vary among measurements.
</p>
<p>The COB LED used is the chip-on-board (COB) Optisolis type 
NFCWL036B-V3-Rfcb0 from Nichia with CRI &gt; 95. Nominal electrical power of
10.3 W at nominal current of 270 mA. So, two spectra are for the COB 
over-driven, which is possible with enough cooling, but not recommended.
</p>
<p>The spectral data are not expressed at constant wavelength intervals. Not
only the intervals vary in the raw data from the array spectrometer, but in
addition function <code><a href="photobiology.html#topic+thin_wl">thin_wl</a></code> has been applied to
reduce the storage space needed. In brief the wavelength interval has been
increased as much as possible in those regions of the spectrum that lack
detailed features (such as linear slopes and wavelength regions with zero
light emission).
</p>

</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The <code>"COB_reflectors.mspct"</code> object contains
<code>"source_spct"</code> objects with spectral irradiance data with the same
Optisolis COB LED from Nichia, and different reflectors from the Mirella-G2
series from LEDiL . Distance from LED to cosine diffuser was 159 mm.
Spectra are not normalized. It needs to be taken into account than even in
these cases measurements have not been done in an optical bench, so values
of spectral irradiance are subject to errors due to possible
misalignment.
</p>
<p>The COB LED used is the chip-on-board (COB) Optisolis type
NFCWL036B-V3-Rfcb0 from Nichia with CRI &gt; 95. Nominal electrical power of
10.3 W at nominal current of 270 mA. Spectra are for the COB over-driven at
350 mA, which is possible with enough cooling, but not recommended.
</p>
<p>The spectral data are not expressed at constant wavelength intervals. Not
only the intervals vary in the raw data from the array spectrometer, but in
addition function <code><a href="photobiology.html#topic+thin_wl">thin_wl</a></code> has been applied to
reduce the storage space needed. In brief the wavelength interval has been
increased as much as possible in those regions of the spectrum that lack
detailed features (such as linear slopes and wavelength regions with zero

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>As described for the individual brands, ownership of brands and companies has
changed over the years through take-overs, mergers and sales of company
divisions. Even when brand names have changed it has been the norm for
electronic components that component type codes are maintained unchanged. In
contrast to some integrated circuits, exact replacement types from multiple
suppliers are not available for LEDs.
</p>


<h3>Agilent/Hewlett Packard</h3>

<p>The character vector <code>Agilent_leds</code> contains the names of the spectra to
facilitate their extraction from the collection.The division of Hewlett
Packard which supplied these LEDs became part of Agilent when this division
spin-off the mother company. More recently the electronic components division
of Agilent became Avago Technologies for a while. Currently, BROADCOM
supplies some of these LEDs or similar improved types.

<h2 id='led_uses'>Spectral data for LEDs for different uses</h2><span id='topic+led_uses'></span><span id='topic+plant_grow_leds'></span><span id='topic+high_CRI_leds'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The collection of spectra <code><a href="#topic+leds.mspct">leds.mspct</a></code> contains spectra for light
emitting diodes (LEDs) designed for specific uses as well as for general 
illumination. The character
vectors described here contain the names of the spectra for LEDs sold for
specific uses to facilitate their extraction from the collection. One
additional vector, <code>led_use</code> contains the wording of uses as 
in the names of the spectra in the collection.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>led_uses

plant_grow_leds

high_CRI_leds
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A vector of character strings.
</p>
<p>An object of class <code>character</code> of length 7.
</p>
<p>An object of class <code>character</code> of length 9.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Most LEDs can be useful in different situations individually or in 
combination with other types. The lists are thus not exclusive but rather
indicate a typical use.
</p>


<h3>Plant grow</h3>

<p>The character vector <code>plant_grow_leds</code> contains the names of the spectra
to facilitate their extraction from the collection. This includes LEDs
designed to be the only light sources as well as LEDs designed to be used
together with other LEDs to assemble luminaires used for plant cultivation,
either as only light source or to supplement natural light.
</p>


<h3>High color reproduction index</h3>

<p>The character vector <code>high_CRI_leds</code> contains the names of the spectra
to facilitate their extraction from the collection. This includes white LEDs
with a high color reproduction index (CRI &gt; 95) as computed from the actual
measured spectra. Nowadays some of these types of LEDs are not only
advertised as good from illumination in museums, exhibitions and as light
sources for video and photography, but also as less stressful to human vision
and in some cases as good for the entraining of the human circadian clock. In
practice this means an emission spectrum covering most of visible light with
only minor peaks and valleys.

<h2 id='leds.mspct'>Spectral irradiance for diverse LEDs</h2><span id='topic+leds.mspct'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A collection of emission spectra of light-emitting-diodes
from different suppliers.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>leds.mspct
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A <code>"source_mspct"</code> object containing 74 
<code>"source_spct"</code> objects.
</p>
<p>In each of the member spectra, the variables are as follows:
</p>

<ul>
<li><p> w.length (nm)  
</p>
</li>
<li><p> s.e.irrad (W m-2 nm-1)
</p>
</li></ul>



<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The <code>"leds.mspct"</code> object contains <code>"source_spct"</code> objects
with spectral irradiance data. As the exact distance from LED to cosine
diffuser and/or the the driving current vary among spectra, they have been
all normalized to the wavelength of maximum spectral energy irradiance.
When the details of the measurement conditions are know, these are stored
as metadata attributes. In any case, it needs to be taken into account than even
in these cases measurements have not been done in an optical bench, so
values of spectral irradiance are subject to errors due to possible
misalignment. The shape of the spectra, in contrast can be relied upon as
measurements were done with well calibrated instruments.
</p>
<p>The output of LEDs at a given current decreases as their temperature
increases. The wavelength at the peak of emission can depend on the
temperature and current, but shifts tend to be only a couple of nanometres.
In LED arrays with heterogeneous LED chips or white LEDs based on secondary
emission from phosphor the shave of the spectrum can slightly change
depending on the drive current and temperature.
</p>
<p>There is variation among LEDs of the same type, specially with respect
wavelength and light output. The data included are for individual LEDs and
can be expected to differ to some extent from the typical values in the
manufacturers specifications. Some of the LEDs for which data are included
are only of historical interest as their production has been discontinued,
usually replaced by new types with enhanced performance. When known, the
approximate &quot;vintage&quot; is provided in the metadata.
</p>
<p>The spectral data are not expressed at constant wavelength intervals. Not
only the intervals vary in the raw data from the array spectrometer, but in
addition function <code><a href="photobiology.html#topic+thin_wl">thin_wl</a></code> has been applied to
reduce the storage space needed. In brief the wavelength interval has been
increased as much as possible in those regions of the spectrum that lack
detailed features (such as linear slopes and wavelength regions with zero
light emission).
