<td>Description:</td>
<td>Generates Muller plot from parental/genealogy/phylogeny information and population/abundance/frequency dynamics data.
    Muller plots are plots which combine information about succession of different OTUs (genotypes, phenotypes, species, ...) and information about dynamics of their abundances (populations or frequencies) over time. They are powerful and fascinating tools to visualize evolutionary dynamics. They may be employed also in study of diversity and its dynamics, i.e. how diversity emerges and how changes over time. They are called Muller plots in honor of Hermann Joseph Muller which used them to explain his idea of Muller's ratchet (Muller, 1932, American Naturalist).
    A big difference between Muller plots and normal box plots of abundances is that a Muller plot depicts not only the relative abundances but also succession of OTUs based on their genealogy/phylogeny/parental relation. In a Muller plot, horizontal axis is time/generations and vertical axis represents relative abundances of OTUs at the corresponding times/generations. Different OTUs are usually shown with polygons with different colors and each OTU originates somewhere in the middle of its parent area in order to illustrate their succession in evolutionary process.
    To generate a Muller plot one needs the genealogy/phylogeny/parental relation of OTUs and their abundances over time.
    MullerPlot package has the tools to generate Muller plots which clearly depict the origin of successors of OTUs.</td>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>attributes:
</p>
<p>First column (character or
numeric) must contain OTU names, the second column (character or numeric) must contain
parents of corresponding OTUs and the third column (optional) can contain colors of corresponding OTUs.
The order of OTUs in the first column determines the order of sister OTUs (OTUs with the same parent)
in the Muller plot. Those parents which are not present in the OTU list
(first column) or in the population dynamics must be substituted by NA. At least one NA
must exist in the second column. All the OTUs present in the rownames of population.data
must exist in the first column of attributes (names). If third column is not provided, random color
will be assigned to OTUs.
</p>
<p>population.data:
</p>
<p>When data.method is &quot;list&quot; population.data must have 3 columns. The first column
(character or numeric) contains OTU names. The second column (numeric) contains
times or generations. The third column (character) contains abundances of
corresponding OTU at corresponding time.
When data.method is &quot;table&quot; population.data must be an OTU table. rownames of
population.data must be OTU names and colnames of it must be times or
generations. Each column contains abundance of OTUs at that time/generation.
</p>
<p>time.interval.method:
</p>
<p>&quot;linear&quot; means that distances between subsequent time points on time/generation axis is
linear. &quot;equal&quot; means that regardless of the values in time/generation points, subsequent
time points have equal distance.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>OTU names and corresponding colors will be returned.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'> # load information of population/abundance/frequency dynamics as list
 data(PopulationDataList)
 # load attributes of OTUs (contains name, parent and color of OTUs)
 data(Attributes)
 # Muller plot
 Muller.plot(attributes = Attributes, population.data = PopulationDataList,data.method = "list",
             time.interval.method = "linear")

 # load information of population/abundance/frequency dynamics as table
 data(PopulationDataTable)
 # Muller plot
 Muller.plot(attributes = Attributes, population.data = PopulationDataTable,data.method = "table")
