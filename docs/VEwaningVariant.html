<td>Description:</td>
<td>Implements methods for inference on potential waning of vaccine efficacy and for estimation of vaccine efficacy at a user-specified time after vaccination based on data from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled vaccine trial in which participants may be unblinded and placebo subjects may be crossed over to the study vaccine.  The methods also for variant stratification and allow adjustment for possible confounding via inverse probability weighting through specification of models for the trial entry process, unblinding mechanisms, and the probability an unblinded placebo participant accepts study vaccine.</td>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>When the variant under analysis is present only in the unblinded phase, 
vaccine efficacy cannot be estimated. In this case, plot() shows the  
relative infection rate at times t since full efficacy reached, defined  
as infection rate at time t = time since full efficacy reached  
divided by the infection rate at the time full efficacy is reached (t=0).
