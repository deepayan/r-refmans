<td>Description:</td>
<td>Calculates two sets of post-hoc variable importance measures for multivariate random forests. The first set of variable importance measures are given by the sum of mean split improvements for splits defined by feature j measured on user-defined examples (i.e., training or testing samples). The second set of importance measures are calculated on a per-outcome variable basis as the sum of mean absolute difference of node values for each split defined by feature j measured on user-defined examples (i.e., training or testing samples). The user can optionally threshold both sets of importance measures to include only splits that are statistically significant as measured using an F-test. </td>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>For each split defined by feature j, the mean outcome difference importance function calculates the absolute
difference in mean values per outcome between the left and right children nodes of the resultant split. With a
multivariate outcome vector, this measure thus gives a vector of importance measures for feature j, i.e., it returns
an outcome specific importance measure for feature j. If feature j is used in splitting M nodes of the tree, the
resulting tree-specific importance measure is the sum of the node-specific absolute differences in mean nodal
values per outcome calculated across all M nodes. For the multivariate random forest, the mean outcome difference
importance measure for feature j is the average of the tree-specific measures across all trees in the forest.
</p>
<p>If the alpha threshold is 0 all the splits defined by feature j will be used in computing the importance measure.
The user also has the option of including only the significant node splits defined by feature j in the calculation
of the importance measure.  The significance of node splits is measured using an F-test. In this case, the user will
matrix and the number of left and right node samples for the given node split.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The mean split improvement importance function follows directly from Segal (1992) definition of the
mean structure based split function. For each split defined by feature j, it calculates the difference between the within
parent node sum of squares and the within children-nodes (left and right nodes) measured on either training or testing samples.
If feature j is used in splitting M nodes of the tree, the resulting tree-specific importance measure is the sum of the
node-specific differences calculated across all M nodes. The mean split improvement measure for feature j for the multivariate
random forest is the average of the tree-specific measures across all trees in the forest.
</p>
<p>If the alpha threshold is 0 all the splits defined by feature j will be used in computing the importance measure. The user also has
the option of including only the significant node splits defined by feature j in the calculation of the importance measure.  The
significance of node splits is measured using an F-test. In this case, the user will need to threshold the alpha critical value of
the F-statistic based on the number of outcome variables in the target matrix and the number of left and right node samples
for the given node split.
