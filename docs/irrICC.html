<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function computes the lower and upper confidence bounds associated with the ICC under the one-factor ANOVA model
where each subject may be rated by a different group of raters.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>ci.ICC1a(ratings, conflev = 0.95)

if a subject was assigned multiple ratings) and each of the remaining columns is associated with a particular rater and contains its
numeric ratings.</p>
