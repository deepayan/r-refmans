<h2 id='AverageMovesToWin'>The Average Moves to Win in a Game of Snakes and Ladders</h2><span id='topic+AverageMovesToWin'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function uses the function SnakesAndLaddersGame to estimate the average number of moves to win given any amount of players and allows you to change the number of trials used.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>AverageMovesToWin(number.of.players = 2, number.of.trials = 1000)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table role = "presentation">
<tr><td><code id="AverageMovesToWin_+3A_number.of.players">number.of.players</code></td>
<td>
<p>A single numeric value that represents the number of players you wish to run the trial with</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="AverageMovesToWin_+3A_number.of.trials">number.of.trials</code></td>
<td>
<p>A single numeric value that represents the number of trials you wish to run. The more trials the more accurate the estimation.</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Function uses a simple for loop to run many trials of the SnakesAndLaddersGame, counts the number of moves and outputs an average.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<table role = "presentation">
<tr><td><code>average.number.of.moves</code></td>
<td>
<p>A numeric value which represents the average number of moves to win</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Warning</h3>

<p>I have not put a limit on the amount of time that this function will run. This is to allow millions of trials.
</p>

</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Function uses the SnakesAndLaddersGame function to find and display the frequency of how often a square is landed on, given a set number of players. it is also very useful to plot this data to see the distribution of how often a square is landed on.
</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Function uses the SnakesAndLaddersGame function to find and display the ladders used by the winners. As the number of players increase we see a steady state forming of the same ladders. This results in us working out which ladders are key to land on if you want to win.

<h2 id='SnakesAndLaddersGame'>Plays the Game of Snakes and Ladders</h2><span id='topic+SnakesAndLaddersGame'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This is a function that will run the game of snakes and ladders for as many players as you want.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>SnakesAndLaddersGame(number.of.players = 2)

</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table role = "presentation">
<tr><td><code id="SnakesAndLaddersGame_+3A_number.of.players">number.of.players</code></td>
<td>
<p>a single numeric value representing the number of players. Must be greater than 0.</p>
</td></tr>

<p> We use matrices here to make computations very fast and allowing millions of iterations.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<table role = "presentation">
<tr><td><code>game.output</code></td>
<td>
<p>A matrix which displays the entire game of snakes and ladders.</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Warning </h3>

<p> Do not put too many players in as your computer may crash. I have not put a limit on run time as people with more powerful computers will want to run it for longer.</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>An assumption that has been made is that everyone will get the same amount of rolls, irrespective of if someone has already won. This is to keep the game fair. This sometimes results in more than one player winning. This is rare when the player count is below 7 but as it grows the liklyhood of this increases dramatically. This is useful in some parts of the analysis.
</p>
<p>The starting position for all players is 0.
</p>
<p>The ladders used were:
</p>
<p>1 to 38
</p>
<p>4 to 14
</p>
<p>9 to 31
</p>
<p>21 to 42
</p>
<p>28 to 84
</p>
<p>36 to 44
</p>
<p>51 to 67
</p>
<p>71 to 91
</p>
<p>80 to 100
</p>
<p>The snakes used were:
</p>
<p>16 to 6
</p>
<p>47 to 26
</p>
<p>49 to 11
</p>
<p>56 to 53
</p>
<p>62 to 19
</p>
<p>64 to 60
</p>
<p>87 to 24
</p>
<p>93 to 73
</p>
<p>95 to 75
</p>
<p>98 to 78
</p>
<p>The only check i have put in this function is to ensure that the number of players is greater than 0. This is because I want it to run at maximum efficieny and I have only included this check to ensure that the code does not go on for ever, which it would if number.of.players = 0 was inputted.
