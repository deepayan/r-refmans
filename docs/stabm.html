<p>Adjusted Stability Measures
</p>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table role = "presentation">
<tr><td><code id="adjustedDocumentation_+3A_correction.for.chance">correction.for.chance</code></td>
<td>
<p><code>character(1)</code><br />
How should the expected value of the stability score (see Details)
be assessed? Options are &quot;estimate&quot;, &quot;exact&quot; and &quot;none&quot;.
For &quot;estimate&quot;, <code>N</code> random feature sets of the same sizes as the input feature
sets (<code>features</code>) are generated.
For &quot;exact&quot;, all possible combinations of feature sets of the same
sizes as the input feature sets are used. Computation is only feasible for very
small numbers of features and numbers of considered datasets (<code>length(features)</code>).
For &quot;none&quot;, the transformation <code class="reqn">(score - expected) / (maximum - expected)</code>
is not conducted, i.e. only <code class="reqn">score</code> is used.
This is not recommended.</p>

<h2 id='listStabilityMeasures'>List All Available Stability Measures</h2><span id='topic+listStabilityMeasures'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Lists all stability measures of package <em>stabm</em> and
provides information about them.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>listStabilityMeasures()
</code></pre>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>data.frame</code> <br />
For each stability measure, its name,
the information, whether it is corrected for chance by definition,
the information, whether it is adjusted for similar features,
its minimal value and its maximal value are displayed.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>The given minimal values might only be reachable
in some scenarios, e.g. if the feature sets have a certain size.
The measures which are not corrected for chance by definition can
be corrected for chance with <code>correction.for.chance</code>.
This however changes the minimal value.
For the adjusted stability measures, the minimal value depends
on the similarity structure.
</p>

<hr>
<h2 id='plotFeatures'>Plot Selected Features</h2><span id='topic+plotFeatures'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Creates a heatmap of the features which are selected in at least one feature set.
The sets are ordered according to average linkage hierarchical clustering based on the Manhattan
distance. If <code>sim.mat</code> is given, the features are ordered according to average linkage
hierarchical clustering based on <code>1 - sim.mat</code>. Otherwise, the features are ordered in
the same way as the feature sets.
</p>
<p>Note that this function needs the packages <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ggplot2"><span class="pkg">ggplot2</span></a>, <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=cowplot"><span class="pkg">cowplot</span></a> and
<a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ggdendro"><span class="pkg">ggdendro</span></a> installed.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>plotFeatures(features, sim.mat = NULL)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table role = "presentation">
<tr><td><code id="plotFeatures_+3A_features">features</code></td>
<td>
<p><code>list (length &gt;= 2)</code><br />
Chosen features per dataset. Each element of the list contains the features for one dataset.

</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="plotFeatures_+3A_sim.mat">sim.mat</code></td>
<td>
<p><code>numeric matrix</code><br />
Similarity matrix which contains the similarity structure of all features based on
all datasets. The similarity values must be in the range of [0, 1] where 0 indicates
very low similarity and 1 indicates very high similarity. If the list elements of
<code>features</code> are integerish vectors, then the feature numbering must correspond to the
ordering of <code>sim.mat</code>. If the list elements of <code>features</code> are character
vectors, then <code>sim.mat</code> must be named and the names of <code>sim.mat</code> must correspond
to the entries in <code>features</code>.</p>

<h2 id='stabilityDavis'>Stability Measure Davis</h2><span id='topic+stabilityDavis'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The stability of feature selection is defined as the robustness of
the sets of selected features with respect to small variations in the data on which the
feature selection is conducted. To quantify stability, several datasets from the
same data generating process can be used. Alternatively, a single dataset can be
split into parts by resampling. Either way, all datasets used for feature selection must
contain exactly the same features. The feature selection method of interest is
applied on all of the datasets and the sets of chosen features are recorded.
The stability of the feature selection is assessed based on the sets of chosen features
using stability measures.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>stabilityDavis(
  features,
  p,
  correction.for.chance = "none",
  N = 10000,
  impute.na = NULL,
  penalty = 0
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table role = "presentation">
<tr><td><code id="stabilityDavis_+3A_features">features</code></td>
<td>
<p><code>list (length &gt;= 2)</code><br />
Chosen features per dataset. Each element of the list contains the features for one dataset.

</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="stabilityDavis_+3A_p">p</code></td>

</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="stabilityDavis_+3A_correction.for.chance">correction.for.chance</code></td>
<td>
<p><code>character(1)</code><br />
Should a correction for chance be applied? Correction for chance means that if
features are chosen at random, the expected value must be independent of the number
of chosen features. To correct for chance, the original score is transformed by
<code class="reqn">(score - expected) / (maximum - expected)</code>. For stability measures whose
score is the average value of pairwise scores, this transformation
is done for all components individually.
Options are &quot;none&quot;, &quot;estimate&quot; and &quot;exact&quot;.
For &quot;none&quot;, no correction is performed, i.e. the original score is used.
For &quot;estimate&quot;, <code>N</code> random feature sets of the same sizes as the input
feature sets (<code>features</code>) are generated.
For &quot;exact&quot;, all possible combinations of feature sets of the same
sizes as the input feature sets are used. Computation is only feasible for very
small numbers of features (<code>p</code>) and numbers of considered datasets

</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="stabilityDavis_+3A_impute.na">impute.na</code></td>
<td>
<p><code>numeric(1)</code><br />
In some scenarios, the stability cannot be assessed based on all feature sets.
E.g. if some of the feature sets are empty, the respective pairwise comparisons yield NA as result.
With which value should these missing values be imputed? <code>NULL</code> means no imputation.</p>
</td></tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The stability measure is defined as (see Notation)
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">\max \left\{ 0, \frac{1}{|V|} \sum_{j=1}^p \frac{h_j}{m} - \frac{penalty}{p}
\cdot \mathop{\mathrm{median}} \{ |V_1|, \ldots, |V_m| \}  \right\}.</code>
</p>



<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>numeric(1)</code> Stability value.
</p>


<h3>Notation</h3>

<p>For the definition of all stability measures in this package,
the following notation is used:
Let <code class="reqn">V_1, \ldots, V_m</code> denote the sets of chosen features
for the <code class="reqn">m</code> datasets, i.e. <code>features</code> has length <code class="reqn">m</code> and
<code class="reqn">V_i</code> is a set which contains the <code class="reqn">i</code>-th entry of <code>features</code>.
Furthermore, let <code class="reqn">h_j</code> denote the number of sets that contain feature
<code class="reqn">X_j</code> so that <code class="reqn">h_j</code> is the absolute frequency with which feature <code class="reqn">X_j</code>
is chosen.
Analogously, let <code class="reqn">h_{ij}</code> denote the number of sets that include both <code class="reqn">X_i</code> and <code class="reqn">X_j</code>.
Also, let <code class="reqn">q = \sum_{j=1}^p h_j = \sum_{i=1}^m |V_i|</code> and <code class="reqn">V = \bigcup_{i=1}^m V_i</code>.

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The stability of feature selection is defined as the robustness of
the sets of selected features with respect to small variations in the data on which the
feature selection is conducted. To quantify stability, several datasets from the
same data generating process can be used. Alternatively, a single dataset can be
split into parts by resampling. Either way, all datasets used for feature selection must
contain exactly the same features. The feature selection method of interest is
applied on all of the datasets and the sets of chosen features are recorded.
The stability of the feature selection is assessed based on the sets of chosen features
using stability measures.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>stabilityHamming(

<p><code>list (length &gt;= 2)</code><br />

Should a correction for chance be applied? Correction for chance means that if
features are chosen at random, the expected value must be independent of the number
of chosen features. To correct for chance, the original score is transformed by
<code class="reqn">(score - expected) / (maximum - expected)</code>. For stability measures whose
score is the average value of pairwise scores, this transformation
is done for all components individually.
Options are &quot;none&quot;, &quot;estimate&quot; and &quot;exact&quot;.
For &quot;none&quot;, no correction is performed, i.e. the original score is used.
For &quot;estimate&quot;, <code>N</code> random feature sets of the same sizes as the input
feature sets (<code>features</code>) are generated.
For &quot;exact&quot;, all possible combinations of feature sets of the same
sizes as the input feature sets are used. Computation is only feasible for very
small numbers of features (<code>p</code>) and numbers of considered datasets
(<code>length(features)</code>).</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The stability of feature selection is defined as the robustness of
the sets of selected features with respect to small variations in the data on which the
feature selection is conducted. To quantify stability, several datasets from the
same data generating process can be used. Alternatively, a single dataset can be
split into parts by resampling. Either way, all datasets used for feature selection must
contain exactly the same features. The feature selection method of interest is
applied on all of the datasets and the sets of chosen features are recorded.
The stability of the feature selection is assessed based on the sets of chosen features
using stability measures.

very low similarity and 1 indicates very high similarity. If the list elements of
<code>features</code> are integerish vectors, then the feature numbering must correspond to the
ordering of <code>sim.mat</code>. If the list elements of <code>features</code> are character
vectors, then <code>sim.mat</code> must be named and the names of <code>sim.mat</code> must correspond

of chosen features. To correct for chance, the original score is transformed by

score is the average value of pairwise scores, this transformation
is done for all components individually.

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The stability of feature selection is defined as the robustness of
the sets of selected features with respect to small variations in the data on which the
feature selection is conducted. To quantify stability, several datasets from the
same data generating process can be used. Alternatively, a single dataset can be
split into parts by resampling. Either way, all datasets used for feature selection must
contain exactly the same features. The feature selection method of interest is
applied on all of the datasets and the sets of chosen features are recorded.
The stability of the feature selection is assessed based on the sets of chosen features
using stability measures.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>stabilityNovovicova(
  features,
  p = NULL,
  correction.for.chance = "none",
  N = 10000,
  impute.na = NULL
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table role = "presentation">
<tr><td><code id="stabilityNovovicova_+3A_features">features</code></td>
<td>
<p><code>list (length &gt;= 2)</code><br />
Chosen features per dataset. Each element of the list contains the features for one dataset.
The features must be given by their names (<code>character</code>) or indices (<code>integerish</code>).</p>
</td></tr>

<td>
<p><code>character(1)</code><br />
Should a correction for chance be applied? Correction for chance means that if
features are chosen at random, the expected value must be independent of the number
of chosen features. To correct for chance, the original score is transformed by
<code class="reqn">(score - expected) / (maximum - expected)</code>. For stability measures whose
score is the average value of pairwise scores, this transformation
is done for all components individually.
Options are &quot;none&quot;, &quot;estimate&quot; and &quot;exact&quot;.
For &quot;none&quot;, no correction is performed, i.e. the original score is used.
For &quot;estimate&quot;, <code>N</code> random feature sets of the same sizes as the input
feature sets (<code>features</code>) are generated.
For &quot;exact&quot;, all possible combinations of feature sets of the same
sizes as the input feature sets are used. Computation is only feasible for very
small numbers of features (<code>p</code>) and numbers of considered datasets
(<code>length(features)</code>).</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The stability of feature selection is defined as the robustness of
the sets of selected features with respect to small variations in the data on which the
feature selection is conducted. To quantify stability, several datasets from the
same data generating process can be used. Alternatively, a single dataset can be
split into parts by resampling. Either way, all datasets used for feature selection must
contain exactly the same features. The feature selection method of interest is
applied on all of the datasets and the sets of chosen features are recorded.
The stability of the feature selection is assessed based on the sets of chosen features
using stability measures.

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Uncorrected Stability Measures
</p>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table role = "presentation">
<tr><td><code id="uncorrectedDocumentation_+3A_p">p</code></td>
<td>
<p><code>numeric(1)</code><br />
Total number of features in the datasets.
Required, if <code>correction.for.chance</code> is set to &quot;estimate&quot; or &quot;exact&quot;.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="uncorrectedDocumentation_+3A_correction.for.chance">correction.for.chance</code></td>
<td>
<p><code>character(1)</code><br />
Should a correction for chance be applied? Correction for chance means that if
features are chosen at random, the expected value must be independent of the number
of chosen features. To correct for chance, the original score is transformed by
<code class="reqn">(score - expected) / (maximum - expected)</code>. For stability measures whose
score is the average value of pairwise scores, this transformation
is done for all components individually.
Options are &quot;none&quot;, &quot;estimate&quot; and &quot;exact&quot;.
For &quot;none&quot;, no correction is performed, i.e. the original score is used.
For &quot;estimate&quot;, <code>N</code> random feature sets of the same sizes as the input
feature sets (<code>features</code>) are generated.
For &quot;exact&quot;, all possible combinations of feature sets of the same
sizes as the input feature sets are used. Computation is only feasible for very
small numbers of features (<code>p</code>) and numbers of considered datasets
(<code>length(features)</code>).</p>
