<td>Description:</td>
<td>Finds adaptive strategies for sequential symmetric 
    games using a genetic algorithm. Currently, any symmetric two by two matrix
    is allowed, and strategies can remember the history of an opponent's play
    from the previous three rounds of moves in iterated interactions between
    players. The genetic algorithm returns a list of adaptive strategies given
    payoffs, and the mean fitness of strategies in each generation.</td>

<h2 id='games_ga'>Games genetic algorithm:</h2><span id='topic+games_ga'></span>

<p>This function runs a genetic algorithm that identifies sequential strategies 
for maximising payoffs given any two by two symmetrical payoff matrix. 
Simulated players remember three rounds into the past.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>games_ga(CC = 3, CD = 0, DC = 5, DD = 1, callC = TRUE,
  generations = 250, rounds = 100, num_opponents = 100,

</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr><td><code id="games_ga_+3A_cc">CC</code></td>
<td>
<p>The number of points awarded to a focal agent when the focal agent 
and its opponent both cooperate</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="games_ga_+3A_cd">CD</code></td>
<td>
<p>The number of points awarded to a focal agent when the focal agent
cooperates and its opponent defects</p>

and its opponent both defect</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="games_ga_+3A_callc">callC</code></td>

While not calling c is an option, the default value is TRUE because using the
compiled c code greatly speeds up the genetic algorithm, making the whole
program run much faster</p>

<td>
<p>The number of generations the genetic algorithm will run
before returning selected genotypes and fitness history. Each generation

<td>
<p>The number of rounds of the game that a focal player will play
against its opponent before moving on to the next opponent. Rounds are played
iteratively against opponents, allowing the history of interactions to affect
strategies and therefore total payoffs after all rounds are completed</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="games_ga_+3A_num_opponents">num_opponents</code></td>
<td>
<p>The number of randomly selected opponents that a focal
player will play during the course of one generation; the focal player will
play in the same number of rounds with each opponent</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="games_ga_+3A_cross_prob">cross_prob</code></td>
<td>
<p>A uniform probability of random crossing over event for a 
focal player's locus with the same locus from another randomly selected 
player.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="games_ga_+3A_mutation_prob">mutation_prob</code></td>
<td>
<p>The probability that a given locus will mutate; mutation
from 'C' to 'D' occurs with the same probability as 'D' to 'C' (no bias)</p>
</td></tr>
</table>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function launches a graphical user interface (GUI) within a browser for 
the games_ga function, which runs a genetic algorithm that identifies 
sequential strategies for maximising payoffs given any two by two symmetrical 
payoff matrix. Simulated players remember three rounds into the past. 
Outputs include a table of survivng adaptive strategies and a plot of mean
strategy fitness over generations of the genetic algorithm. No arguments are
required (or available) for this function &ndash; it only launces the GUI.
