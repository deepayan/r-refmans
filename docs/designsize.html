<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Let there are &quot;A&quot; patients at the dose level &quot;i&quot; and also consider &quot;C&quot; and &quot;D&quot; as
predetermined value where (D &gt;= C).
</p>
<p>If less than C patients have DLTs out of A patints then we escalate the dose at
(i+1)th level and if more than D have the DLT's out of A then we consider the
previous dose level (i-1)th as MTD(maximum dose level with toxicity rates occurring
no more than a predetermined value).
</p>
<p>If more than C and less than D
patients have DLTs then we add B more patients at the ith dose level and then if more than E (E &gt;= D) out
of (A+B) patients have the DLTs then we consider the previous dose level as MTD.
</p>
<p>Now we are going to determine the expected number of sample size at the jth dose level.

<p># prop = Vector of DLT rates at different dose level

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>In cluster-randomized trials (CRTs), matching is a technique that can be used to improve
covariate balance. Matching protects against chance imbalances in baseline covariate distributions and is
thought to improve study credibility. Matching is also implemented to increase study power. Pairs of similar
clusters are formed and then one cluster from the pair is randomized to group 1 while the other is assigned
to group 2. Now we are going to determine the number of cluster in each group.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>crt.match returns a value indicating the number of clusters needed per group

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Instead of independent individuals, the unit of randomization is a group of subjects in a cluster
randomized trial(s) or group randomized trial(s). CRTs are generally more complex and the investigators
consider the selection of the unit of randomization and the unit of inference, matching or stratification
to improve treatment balance across clusters. It is also well known that CRTs need more subjects than
individually randomized trials to be adequately powered.
</p>
<p>Under unmatched case, no pair of matching is used to control the balance. The simple randomization
technique is generally used.
</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Our aim is to determine the sample size based on the hazard rates for median survival times between
control drug and test drug. Since, the hazard function is constant for an exponential distribution, the
median survival time is determined by the hazard function. Moreover, comparing the hazard rates between
the treatment drugs is our hypothesis of interest.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>expsize returns a sample size for control and test drug intervention.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The proportional hazards assumption is used for comparing time to event data where, we assume that
the hazard function is the product of two components. One component is the non-parametric part which
is generally called baseline hazard and another one is the parametric part. The covariates of this
regression model are included in the later component. Because of the combination of parametric and
non-parametric components, the model is known as semi-parametric model.

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>phsize returns a sample size for the control and the test drug intervention.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>A pre-study power analysis for sample size determination is usually performed to calculate an appropriate
sample size for achieving a desired power for detecting a clinically meaningful difference at a prespecified
level of significance. In practice, a much larger sample size is expected for detecting a relatively smaller
difference, especially for clinical trials with extremely low incidence rate. As a result, sample size
determination based on power analysis may not be feasible. So, it is a good suggestion to determine the
sample size based on precision analysis.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Parallel arm design is the most commonly used study design where subjects are randomized
to one or more study arms. Each study arm will be allocated a different intervention.
After randomization each subject will stay in their assigned arm during the whole study.
The randomized subjects should not inadvertently contaminate with the other group. A major
characteristic of a parallel study is randomization, which ensures accuracy of the results
and lower risk of being biased.
