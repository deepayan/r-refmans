<td>Description:</td>
<td>Implements an algorithm for efficient and exact calculation of hypergeometric 
    and binomial probabilities using Chebyshev polynomials, while other algorithm use an 
    approximation when N is large. A useful applications is also considered in this package 
    for the construction of attribute sampling plans which is an important field of statistical
    quality control. The quantile, and the confidence limit for the attribute sampling plan are
    also implemented in this package. The hypergeometric distribution can be represented in 
    terms of Chebyshev polynomials. This representation is particularly useful in the calculation
    of exact values of hypergeometric variables. </td>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This is an algorithm for efficient and exact calculation of hypergeometric probabilities using Chebyshev polynomials. For a fixed population size N and fixed sample size n, such calculations simultaneously produce distributions for all possible values of the population number of &quot;successes&quot; M.
</p>
<p>The well-known hypergeometric distribution arises in the combinatorial problem in which a finite population of N ob-jects contains M of one kind which may be labeled &quot;success.&quot; A sample of n objects is picked without replacement from this set of N objects and it is wished to find the probability that the sample contains exactly x objects labeled &quot;success&quot;, where x = 0,1, ... ,N. The probability of observing exactly x such objects is given by The hypergeometric distribution is used for sampling without replacement:
</p>
<p>p(x)=choose(M,x)choose(N-M,n-x)/choose(N,n)
</p>
<p>where max(0,n-N+M)&lt;=x&lt;=min(n,M)
</p>
<p>This algorthim calculate the exact probability even for large N of n, while other algorthims simply use binomial approximation.

<h2 id='hypersampleplan'> Attribute sampling plans with Hypergeometric Probabilities using Chebyshev Polynomials

</h2><span id='topic+hypersampleplan'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Attribute sampling is an important field of statistical quality control. When a lot is submitted for inspection of quality control, a sampling plan must specify both the number of samples to be drawn from the lot as well as the acceptance number which is the maximum number of defective items found in the sample that would still make the lot acceptable. Since the sample is not free of defective, there are probabilities of accepting a lot which is actually not acceptable and of rejecting one which is acceptable. The hypergeometric distribution using Chebyshev Polynomials forms the basis for calculating those exact probabilities.
</p>
<p>This algorithm is proposed to generate an online table which displays the values of the sample size and the acceptance number given the values of proportional defective, associated risks and lot size. In this table, one can check the values for sample size and acceptance number according to every possible group of values of risks, proportional defective, and lot size.

</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>hypersampleplan(a, a.prime, b, b.prime, k1, k2, N)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<p> Producer's risk alpha: the probability of rejecting a lot for proportion defective

</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="hypersampleplan_+3A_a.prime">a.prime</code></td>

</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="hypersampleplan_+3A_n">N</code></td>
<td>
<p> Lot Size

</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>a matrix that contains the values of the sample size n and acceptance number c (number of defective units allowed in a lot which is accepted).In this table, one can check the values for sample size and acceptance number according to every possible group of values of risks, proportional defective, and lot size.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>The Calculateion of Hypergeometric Probabilities involved is using Chebyshev Polynomials which is exact calculation campared to other methods using approximations.
</p>
<p>The values for a.prime and b.prime can always set to be zero. However, to save the execution time, it is not suggested to set them too far from the pre-specified a and b. If the ranges are too narrow and no sampling plan is returned, the message “the ranges for alpha and/or beta are too
narrow, please reselect them” will appear. Under this circumstance, one needs to widen the range for a or b or both.

</h2><span id='topic+hypersampleplan.CL'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Attribute sampling is an important field of statistical quality control. When a lot is submitted for inspection of quality control, a sampling plan must specify both the number of samples to be drawn from the lot as well as the acceptance number which is the maximum number of defective items found in the sample that would still make the lot acceptable. Since the sample is not free of defective, there are probabilities of accepting a lot which is actually not acceptable and of rejecting one which is acceptable. The hypergeometric distribution using Chebyshev Polynomials forms the basis for calculating those exact probabilities.
</p>
<p>This algorithm is proposed to compute upper and lower confidence limits for the number of defective in a lot given (n, x,N)

</p>

</table>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>a matrix that provides one-sided confidence limits. For a lower confidence limit the confidence is CL.Lower; for an upper confidence limit the confidence is CL.Upper; for a two-sided limit it is CL.Upper - CL.Lower.
</p>
<p>The value of k is interpreted as: For lower confidence limits, one can be (1 - Conf.Limits.1)% sure that the number of defective units in the lot is at least k1. For upper confidence limits, one can be (Conf.Limits.2)% sure that the number of defective units in the lot is at most k2.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>Since the real probability cannot be just equal to 0.95 or 975 and 0.025 or 0.05, the ranges are then taken to allow the output to include all possible values. It can be certainly changed to any ranges without interference with the execution of the program itself except the execution time may be shorter or longer.
