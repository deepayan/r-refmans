<h3>Overview</h3>

<p><span class="pkg">lslx</span> is a package for fitting semi-confirmatory structural equation modeling (SEM) via penalized likelihood (PL) developed by Huang, Chen, and Weng (2017).
In this semi-confirmatory method, an SEM model is distinguished into two parts: a confirmatory part and an exploratory part.
The confirmatory part includes all of the freely estimated parameters and fixed parameters that are allowed for theory testing.
The exploratory part is composed by a set of penalized parameters describing relationships that cannot be clearly determined by available substantive theory.
By implementing a sparsity-inducing penalty and choosing an optimal penalty level, the relationships in the exploratory part can be efficiently identified by the sparsity pattern of these penalized parameters.
After Version 0.6.7, <span class="pkg">lslx</span> also supports penalized least squares for SEM with ordianl data under delta parameterization. 
The technical details of <span class="pkg">lslx</span> can be found in its JSS paper (Huang, 2020) &lt;doi:10.18637/jss.v093.i07&gt; or Vignette for Package lslx (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lslx/vignettes/vignette-lslx.pdf).
</p>
<p>The main function <code>lslx</code> generates an object of <code>lslx</code> R6 class.
R6 class is established via package <span class="pkg">R6</span> (Chang, 2017) that facilitates encapsulation object-oriented programming in <span class="pkg">R</span> system.
Hence, the <code>lslx</code> object is self-contained.
On the one hand, <code>lslx</code> object stores model, data, and fitting results.
On the other hand, it has many built-in methods to respecify model, fit the model to data, and test goodness of fit and coefficients.
The initialization of a new <code>lslx</code> object requires importing a model and a data set to be analyzed.
After an <code>lslx</code> object is initialized, build-in methods can be used to modify the object, find the estimates, and summarize fitting result.
Details of object initialization is described in the section of <em>Initialize Method</em>.
</p>
<p>In the current semi-confirmatory approach, the model specification is quite similar to the traditional practice of SEM except that some parameters can be set as penalized.
Model specification in <code>lslx</code> mainly relies on the argument model when creating a new <code>lslx</code> object.
After a <code>lslx</code> object is initialized, the initialized model can be still modified by set-related methods.
These set-related methods may hugely change the initialized model by just one simple command.
This two-step approach allows users specifying their own models flexibly and efficiently.
Details of the model specification can be found in the sections of <em>Model Syntax</em> and <em>Set-Related Methods</em>.
</p>
<p>Given a penalty level, <span class="pkg">lslx</span> finds a PL estimate by minimizing a penalized maximum likelihood (ML) loss or a least squares loss functions (including OLS, DWLS, and WLS).
The penalty function can be set as lasso (Tibshirani, 1996), ridge (Hoerl &amp; Kennard, 1970), elastic net (Zou &amp; Hastie, 2005), or mcp (minimax concave penalty; Zhang, 2010).
<span class="pkg">lslx</span> solves the optimization problem based on an improved <span class="pkg">glmnet</span> method (Friedman, Hastie, &amp; Tibshirani, 2010) made by Yuan, Ho, and Lin (2012).
The underlying optimizer is written by using <span class="pkg">Rcpp</span> (Eddelbuettel &amp; Francois, 2011) and <span class="pkg">RcppEigen</span> (Bates &amp; Eddelbuettel, 2013).
Our experiences show that the algorithm can efficiently find a local minimum provided that (1) the starting value is reasonable, and (2) the saturated covariance matrix is not nearly singular.
Details of optimization algorithm and how to implement the algorithm can be found in the sections of <em>Optimization Algorithm</em> and <em>Fit-Related Methods</em>.
</p>
<p>When conducting SEM, missing data are easily encountered.
<span class="pkg">lslx</span> can handle missing data problem by listwise deletion and two-step methods.
Details of the methods for missing data can be found in the section of <em>Missing Data</em>.
</p>
<p>After fitting the specified model to data under all of the considered penalty levels, an optimal penalty level should be chosen.
A naive method for penalty level selection is using information criteria.
Huang, Chen, and Weng (2017) have shown the asymptotic properties of Akaike information criterion (AIC) and Bayesian information criterion (BIC) in selecting the penalty level.
In <span class="pkg">lslx</span>, information criteria other an AIC and BIC can be also used.
However, the empirical performances of these included criteria should be further studied.
Details of choosing an optimal penalty level can be found in the section of <em>Penalty Level Selection</em>.
</p>
<p>Given a penalty level, it is important to evaluate the goodness-of-fit of selected model and coefficients.
In <span class="pkg">lslx</span>, it is possible to make statistical inferences for goodness-of-fit and coefficients.
However, the inference methods assume that no model selection is conducted, which is not true in the case of using PL.
After version 0.6.4, several post-selection mehtods are available (Huang, 2019b).
Details of statistical inference can be found in the sections of <em>Model Fit Evaluation</em> and <em>Coefficient Evaluation</em>.
Implementations of these methods can be found in the sections of <em>Summarize Method</em> and <em>Test-Related Methods</em>.
</p>
<p>Besides making statistical inference, <code>lslx</code> has methods for plotting the fitting results, include visualizing quality of optimization and the values of information criteria, fit indices, and coefficient estimates.
Details of methods for plotting can be found in the section of <em>Plot-Related Methods</em>.
</p>
<p>An object of <code>lslx</code> R6 class is composed by three R6 class objects: <code>lslxModel</code>, <code>lslxData</code>, and <code>lslxFitting</code>.
<code>lslxModel</code> contains the specified model and <code>lslxData</code> object stores the imported data to be analyzed.
When fitting the model to data, a reduced model and data will be sent to <code>lslxFitting</code>.
After the underlying optimizer finishes its job, the fitting results will be also stored in <code>lslxFitting</code>.
Since the three members are set as private, they can be only assessed by defined member functions.
Other than the three members, quantities that are crucial for SEM can be also extracted, such as model-implied moments, information matrix, and etc..
Details of methods for obtaining private members and SEM-related quantities can be found in the sections of <em>Get-Related Methods</em> and <em>Extract-Related Methods</em>.
</p>


<h3>Model Syntax</h3>

<p>With <span class="pkg">lslx</span> the relationships among observed variables and latent factors are mainly specified via equation-like syntax.
The creation of syntax in <span class="pkg">lslx</span> is highly motivated by <span class="pkg">lavaan</span> (Rosseel, 2012), a successful package for fitting SEM.
However, <span class="pkg">lslx</span> utilizes slightly more complex, but still intuitive operators to describe relations among variables.
</p>
<p><b>Example 1: Multiple Regression Model</b>
</p>
<p>Consider the first example of model that specifies a multiple regression model
</p>
<p><code>y &lt;= x1 + x2</code>
</p>
<p>In this example, an dependent variable <code>y</code> is predicted by <code>x1</code> and <code>x2</code>.
These three variables are all observed variables and should appear in the given data set.
The operator <code>&lt;=</code> means that the regression coefficients from the right-hand side (RHS) variables to the left-hand side (LHS) variables should be freely estimated.
</p>
<p>Although it is a very simple example, at least four important things behind this example should be addressed:
</p>

<ol>
<li><p>For any endogenous variable (i.e., an variable that is influenced by any other variable), its residual term is not required to be specified.
In this example, <code>lslx</code> recognizes <code>y</code> is an endogenous variable and hence the variance of corresponding residual will be set as freely estimated parameter.
It is also possible to explicitly specify the variance of residual of <code>y</code> by <code>y &lt;=&gt; y</code>.
Here, the operator <code>&lt;=&gt;</code> indicates the covariance of the RHS and LHS variables should be freely estimated.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>If all of the specified equations do not contain the intercept variable <code>1</code>, then the intercept of each endogenous and observed variable will be freely estimated.
Since the intercept variable <code>1</code> doesn't appear in this example, the intercept for <code>y</code> will be set as a freely estimated parameter.
We can explicitly set the intercept term by <code>y &lt;= 1</code>.
However, under the situation that many equations are specified, once the intercept variable <code>1</code> appears in some equation, intercept terms in other equations should be explicitly specified.
Otherwise, the intercepts of endogenous and observed variables in other equations will be fixed at zero.

</p>
</li>
<li><p>For any set of exogeneous variables (i.e., variables that are not influenced by any other variable in the specified system),
not only their variances will be freely estimated, but also their pairwise covariances will be set as freely estimated parameters.
In this example, <code>x1</code> and <code>x2</code> are both exogeneous variables.
Hence, their variance and pairwise covariances will be automatically set as freely estimated parameters.
These covariances can be explicitly stated by simply <code>x1 + x2 &lt;=&gt; x1 + x2</code>.
The syntax parser in <code>lslx</code> will consider variance/covariance of each combination of LHS and RHS variables.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>The intercepts (or means) of exogeneous and observed variables are always set as freely estimated parameters.
In this example, the intercepts of <code>x1</code> and <code>x2</code> will be freely estimated.
It can be stated explicitly by <code>x1 + x2 &lt;= 1</code>.
Also, the <code>lslx</code> parser will know that the intercept variable <code>1</code> has effect on all of <code>x1</code> and <code>x2</code>.
</p>
</li></ol>

<p>The previous regression example can be equivalently represented by <code>x1 + x2 =&gt; y</code>.
In <span class="pkg">lslx</span> all of the directed operators can be reversed under the stage of model specification.
Users can choose the directions of operators according to their own preference.
</p>
<p>The unique feature of <span class="pkg">lslx</span> is that all of the parameters can be set as penalized.
To penalize all of the regression coefficients, the equation can be modified as
</p>
<p><code>y &lt;~ x1 + x2</code>
</p>
<p>Here, the operator <code>&lt;~</code> means that the regression coefficients from the RHS variables to the LHS variables should be estimated with penalization.
If only the coefficient of <code>x1</code> should be penalized, we can use prefix to partly modify the equation
</p>
<p><code>y &lt;= pen() * x1 + x2</code>
</p>
<p>or equivalently
</p>
<p><code>y &lt;~ x1 + free() * x2</code>
</p>
<p>Both <code>pen()</code> and <code>free()</code> are prefix to modify the <span class="pkg">lslx</span> operators.
<code>pen()</code> makes the corresponding parameter to be penalized and <code>free()</code> makes it to be freely estimated.
Inside the parentheses, starting values can be specified.
Any prefix must present before some variable name and divided by asterisk <code>*</code>.
Note that prefix can appear in the either RHS or LHS of operators and its function can be 'distributed' to the variables in the other side.
For example, <code>free() * y &lt;~ x1 + x2</code> will be interpreted as that all of the coefficients should be freely estimated.
However, any prefix cannot simultaneously appear on both sides of operators, which may result in an ambiguity specification.
</p>
<p><b>Example 2: Factor Analysis Model</b>
</p>
<p>Now, we consider another example of equation specification.
</p>
<p><code>y1 + y2 + y3 &lt;=: f1</code>
</p>
<p><code>y4 + y5 + y6 &lt;=: f2</code>
</p>
<p><code>y7 + y8 + y9 &lt;=: f3</code>
</p>
<p>This example is a factor analysis model with nine observed variables and three latent factors.
In <span class="pkg">lslx</span>, defining a latent factor can be through the operator <code>&lt;=:</code> which means that the RHS factor is defined by LHS observed variables.
The observed variables must be presented in the given data set.
Of course, <code>f1</code> can be equivalently defined by <code>f1 :=&gt; y1 + y2 + y3</code>.
</p>
<p>As addressed in the first example, the <code>lslx</code> parser will automatically set many parameters that are not directly presented in these equations.
</p>

<ol>
<li> 
<p>In this example, all of the observed variables are directed by some latent factor and hence they are endogenous.
The variances of their residuals will be set as freely estimated parameters.
Also, their intercepts will be freely estimated since no intercept variable <code>1</code> presents in the specified equations.

</p>
</li>
<li> 
<p>The three latent factors <code>f1</code>, <code>f2</code>, and <code>f3</code> are exogenous variables.
Their pairwise covariances will be also set as freely estimated parameters.
However, because they are latent but not observed, their intercepts will be fixed at zero.
If user hope to estimate the latent factor means, they should add an additional equation <code>f1 + f2 + f3 &lt;= 1</code>.
After adding this equation, on the one hand, the latent intercepts will be set as free as indicated by that equation.
On the other hand, since intercept variable <code>1</code> now presents in the specified equations, the intercepts for the endogenous and observed variables will be then fixed at zero.

</p>
</li></ol>

<p>So far, the specification for the factor analysis model is not complete since the scales of factors are not yet determined.
In SEM, there are two common ways for scale setting.
The first way is to fix some loading per factor.
For example, we may respecify the model via
</p>
<p><code>fix(1) * y1 + y2 + y3 &lt;=: f1</code>
</p>
<p><code>fix(1) * y4 + y5 + y6 &lt;=: f2</code>
</p>
<p><code>fix(1) * y7 + y8 + y9 &lt;=: f3</code>
</p>
<p>The prefix <code>fix(1)</code> will fix the corresponding loadings to be one.
Simply using <code>1 * y1</code> will be also interpreted as fixing the loading of <code>y1</code> at one to mimic <span class="pkg">lavaan</span>.
The second way for scale setting is fixing the variance of latent factors, which can be achieved by specifying additional equations
</p>
<p><code>fix(1) * f1 &lt;=&gt; f1</code>
</p>
<p><code>fix(1) * f2 &lt;=&gt; f2</code>
</p>
<p><code>fix(1) * f3 &lt;=&gt; f3</code>
</p>
<p>Note that in the current version of <span class="pkg">lslx</span>, scale setting will be not made automatically.
Users must accomplish it manually.
</p>
<p>When conducting factor analysis, we may face the problem that each variable may not be influenced by only one latent factor.
The semi-confirmatory factor analysis, which penalizes some part of loading matrix, can be applied in this situation.
One possible model specification for the semi-confirmatory approach is
</p>
<p><code>y1 + y2 + y3 &lt;=: f1</code>
</p>
<p><code>y4 + y5 + y6 &lt;=: f2</code>
</p>
<p><code>y7 + y8 + y9 &lt;=: f3</code>
</p>
<p><code>y4 + y5 + y6 + y7 + y8 + y9 &lt;~: f1</code>
</p>
<p><code>y1 + y2 + y3 + y7 + y8 + y9 &lt;~: f2</code>
</p>
<p><code>y4 + y5 + y6 + y7 + y8 + y9 &lt;~: f3</code>
</p>
<p><code>fix(1) * f1 &lt;=&gt; f1</code>
</p>
<p><code>fix(1) * f2 &lt;=&gt; f2</code>
</p>
<p><code>fix(1) * f3 &lt;=&gt; f3</code>
</p>
<p>In this specification, loadings in the non-independent cluster will be also estimated but with penalization.
</p>
<p>After version 0.6.3, <span class="pkg">lslx</span> supports basic <span class="pkg">lavaan</span> operators. 
The previous model can be equivalently specified as
</p>
<p><code>f1 =~ y1 + y2 + y3</code>
</p>
<p><code>f2 =~ y4 + y5 + y6</code>
</p>
<p><code>f3 =~ y7 + y8 + y9</code>
</p>
<p><code>pen() * f1 =~ y4 + y5 + y6 + y7 + y8 + y9</code>
</p>
<p><code>pen() * f2 =~ y1 + y2 + y3 + y7 + y8 + y9</code>
</p>
<p><code>pen() * f3 =~ y4 + y5 + y6 + y7 + y8 + y9</code>
</p>
<p><code>f1 ~~ 1 * f1</code>
</p>
<p><code>f2 ~~ 1 * f2</code>
</p>
<p><code>f3 ~~ 1 * f3</code>
</p>
<p><b>Example 3: Path Models with both Observed Variables and Latent Factors</b>
</p>
<p>In the third example, we consider a path model with both observed variables and latent factors
</p>
<p><code>fix(1) * y1 + y2 + y3 &lt;=: f1</code>
</p>
<p><code>fix(1) * y4 + y5 + y6 &lt;=: f2</code>
</p>
<p><code>fix(1) * y7 + y8 + y9 &lt;=: f3</code>
</p>
<p><code>f3 &lt;= f1 + f2</code>
</p>
<p><code>f1 + f2 + f3 &lt;~ x1 + x2</code>
</p>
<p><code>f1 &lt;~&gt; f2</code>
</p>
<p>The first three equations specify the measurement model for <code>y1</code> - <code>y9</code> and <code>f1</code> - <code>f3</code>.
The forth equation describes the relations among latent factor.
The fifth equation sets all the coefficients from <code>x1</code> - <code>x2</code> to <code>f1</code> - <code>f3</code> to be penalized.
The final equation states that the covariance of residuals of <code>f1</code> and <code>f2</code> is estimated with penalization, which is achieved by the operator <code>&lt;~&gt;</code>.
</p>
<p>Like Example 1 and 2, many parameters in the current example are automatically set by <span class="pkg">lslx</span>.
</p>

<ol>
<li> 
<p>Because <code>y1</code> - <code>y9</code> and <code>f1</code> - <code>f3</code> are all endogenous, the variances of their residuals will be treated as freely estimated parameters.
Also, due to the non-presence of intercept variable <code>1</code>, the intercept of <code>y1</code> - <code>y9</code> will be set as free parameters
and the intercept of <code>f1</code> - <code>f3</code> will be set as zero.

</p>
</li>
<li> 
<p>The variance, intercepts, and pairwise covariances of exogenous and observed variables <code>x1</code> - <code>x2</code> will be all estimated freely.

</p>
</li></ol>

<p>In this example, we can see that model specification in <span class="pkg">lslx</span> is quite flexible.
Like usual SEM, users can specify their models according some substantive theory.
If no theory is available to guide the relationships in some part of the model,
the semi-confirmatory approach can set this part as exploratory by setting the corresponding parameters as penalized.
</p>
<p><b>Example 4: Multi-Group Factor Analysis Model</b>
</p>
<p>In the fourth example, we consider a multi-group factor analysis model.
</p>
<p><code>fix(1) * y1 + y2 + y3 &lt;=: f1</code>
</p>
<p><code>fix(1) * y4 + y5 + y6 &lt;=: f2</code>
</p>
<p><code>fix(1) * y7 + y8 + y9 &lt;=: f3</code>
</p>
<p>The syntax specifies a factor analysis model with nine observed variables and three latent factors.
Loadings for <code>y2</code>, <code>y3</code>, <code>y5</code>, <code>y6</code>, <code>y8</code>, and <code>y9</code> are freely estimated in both groups.
Loadings for <code>y1</code>, <code>y4</code>, and <code>y7</code> are set as fixed for scale setting in both groups.
You may observe that the syntax for multi-group analysis is the same as that for single group analysis.
That is true because in <span class="pkg">lslx</span> a multi-group analysis is mainly identified by specifying a group variable.
If the imported data can be divided into several samples based on some group variable (argument <code>group_variable</code> in <code>new</code> method, please see the section of <em>Initialize Method</em>) for group labeling, <span class="pkg">lslx</span> will automatically conduct multi-group analysis
(see example of <em>Semi-Confirmatory Multi-Group Factor Analysis</em> in the Section of <em>Examples</em>).
</p>
<p>Sometimes, we may hope to specify different model structures for the two groups.
It can be achieved by using vector version of prefix, which is also motivated by the syntax in <span class="pkg">lavaan</span>.
For example, if we hope to restrict the loading for <code>y2</code> to be 1 in the first group but set it as freely estimate parameter in the second group.
Then we may use
</p>
<p><code>fix(1) * y1 + c(fix(1), free()) * y2 + y3 &lt;=: f1</code>
</p>
<p>Note that the order of groups is important here.
Since <span class="pkg">lslx</span> treats the group variable as <code>factor</code>, its order is determined by the sorted name of groups.
For example, if three groups <code>c</code>, <code>a</code>, and <code>b</code> are considered, then the first group is <code>a</code>, the second is <code>b</code>, and the third is <code>c</code>.
</p>
<p>In the current version of <span class="pkg">lslx</span>, coefficient constraints cannot be imposed.
It seems that testing coefficient invariance across groups is impossible in <span class="pkg">lslx</span>.
However, the present package parameterizes group coefficients in different way compared to other SEM software (Huang, 2018).
Under <span class="pkg">lslx</span>, each group coefficient is decomposed into a sum of a reference component and an increment component.
If the reference component is assumed to be zero, the increment component represents the group coefficient, which is equivalent to the usual parameterization in other software solutions.
On the other hand, if some group is set as reference (argument <code>reference_group</code> in <code>new</code> method, please see the section of <em>Initialize Method</em>),
then the reference component now represents the group coefficient of the reference group and other increment components represent the differences from the reference group.
The coefficient invariance across groups can be evaluated by examining the value or sparsity of the corresponding increment component.
</p>


<h3>Optimization Algorithm</h3>

<p>Let <code class="reqn">\theta</code> denote the vector of model parameter.
<span class="pkg">lslx</span> tries to find a PL estimate for <code class="reqn">\theta</code> by minimizing the objective function
<code class="reqn">objective(\theta, \lambda) = loss(\theta) + regularizer(\theta, \lambda)</code>
where <code class="reqn">loss</code> is the ML loss function, <code class="reqn">regularizer</code> is a regularizer, possibly lasso (Tibshirani, 1996) or mcp (Zhang, 2010), and <code class="reqn">\lambda</code> is a regularization parameter.
The optimization algorithm for minimizing the PL criterion is based on an improved <span class="pkg">glmnet</span> method (Friedman, Hastie, &amp; Tibshirani, 2010) made by Yuan, Ho, and Lin (2012).
The algorithm can be understood as a quasi-Newton method with inner loop and outer loop.
The inner loop of the algorithm derives a quasi-Newton direction by minimizing a quadratic approximated objective function via coordinate descent.
To save the computation time, the Hessian matrix for the quadratic term is approximated by the identity matrix, the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) method, or the expected Hessian (Fisher scoring).
Although the computational cost of BFGS approximation is much smaller than calculating expected hessian,
our experience shows that the two methods perform similarly in terms of computation time because more outer iterations are required for BFGS.
The inner loop stops if the change of the derived direction is quite small.
The outer loop of the algorithm updates the value of parameter estimate via the derived quasi-Newton direction and Armijo's rule.
The outer loop stops if the maximal absolute element of subgradient of objective function is smaller than the specified tolerance.
The minimizer is the so-called PL estimates.
Note that the PL estimates is a function of penalty level, i.e., PL estimates can vary under different penalty levels.
An optimal penalty level can be chosen by using model selection criterion.
</p>
<p>In <span class="pkg">lslx</span>, PL estimates under each penalty level and convexity level specified by user will be calculated.
The convexity levels will be sorted from large to small based on the suggestion of Mazumder (2011).
The previous obtained PL estimate will be used as warm start for further minimization problem.
Since the solution path is continuous, the warm start can speed up the convergence of minimization (see Friedman, Hastie, &amp; Tibshirani, 2010).
</p>


<h3>Missing Data</h3>

<p>When conducting SEM, it is easy to encounter the problem of missing data.
In <span class="pkg">lslx</span>, missing data can be handled by the listwise deletion method and the two-stage method (Yuan &amp; Bentler, 2000).
The listwise deletion method only uses fully complete observations for further SEM analysis.
If the missing mechanism is missing completely at random (MCAR; Rubin, 1976), the listwise deletion method can yield a consistent estimator.
The two-stage method first calculates the saturated moments by minimizing the likelihoods based on all of the available observations and then use the obtained saturated moment estimates for further SEM analysis.
Under the assumption of missing at random (MAR; Rubin, 1976), it has been shown that the two-stage method can yield a consistent estimate.
In addition, the standard errors of coefficients can be also consistently estimated if a correct asymptotic covariance of saturated moments is used.
Because the two-stage approach is generally valid and efficient compared to the listwise deletion method,
<span class="pkg">lslx</span> set the two-stage method as default for handling the missing data problem.
The current version also supports the use of auxiliary variables (see Savalei &amp; Bentler, 2008).
If the two-stage method is implemented, the standard error formula will be corrected for the presence of missing data (see Yuan &amp; Lu, 2008 for technical details).
</p>
<p>So far, <span class="pkg">lslx</span> doesn't include the full-information maximum likelihood (FIML) method for missing values.
One reason is that PL can be computationally intensive if many penalty levels are considered.
The additional E-step in each iteration of FIML makes the problem worse.
Another reason is that the two-step method has been shown to outperform FIML in simulation settings (Savalei &amp; Falk, 2014).
Therefore, we tend to believe that the implementation of FIML in PL may not bring further advantages over the two-step method.
</p>


<h3>Penalty Level Selection</h3>

<p>Penalty level selection in <span class="pkg">lslx</span> is based on optimizing the value of some information criterion.
Many information criteria are available for this task.
In the current version, available information criteria are
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>aic</code></dt><dd><p>Akaike Information Criterion (Akaike, 1974)
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">AIC(\theta)=loss(\theta) - (2 / N) * df(\theta) </code>
</p>
 </dd>
<dt><code>aic3</code></dt><dd><p>Akaike Information Criterion with Penalty Being 3 (Sclove, 1987)
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">AIC3(\theta)=loss(\theta) - (3 / N) * df(\theta) </code>
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>caic</code></dt><dd><p>Consistent Akaike Information Criterion (Bozdogan, 1987)
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">CAIC(\theta)=loss(\theta) - ((log(N) + 1) / N) * df(\theta) </code>
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>bic</code></dt><dd><p>Bayesian Information Criterion (Schwarz, 1978)
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">BIC(\theta)=loss(\theta) - (log(N) / N) * df(\theta) </code>
</p>
 </dd>
<dt><code>abic</code></dt><dd><p>Adjusted Bayesian Information Criterion (Sclove, 1987)
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">ABIC(\theta)=loss(\theta) - (log((N + 2) / 24 ) / N) * df(\theta) </code>
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>hbic</code></dt><dd><p>Haughton Bayesian Information Criterion (Haughton, 1997)
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">HBIC(\theta)=loss(\theta) - (log(N / \pi ) / N) * df(\theta) </code>
</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>where
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><code class="reqn">N</code>: total number of sample size;

</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code class="reqn">G</code>: total number of group;

</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code class="reqn">loss(\theta)</code>: the loss value under estimate <code class="reqn">\theta</code>;

</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code class="reqn">df(\theta)</code>: the degree of freedom defined as (1) <code class="reqn">G * P * (P + 3) / 2 - e(\theta)</code> with <code class="reqn">e(\theta)</code> being the number of non-zero elements in <code class="reqn">\theta</code> for Lasso and MCP; 
or (2) the expectation of likelihood ratio statistics with ridge for ridge and elastic net.

</p>
</li></ul>

<p>Note the formula for calculating the information criteria in <span class="pkg">lslx</span> are different to other software solutions.
The loss function value is used to replace the likelihood function value and hence the penalty term is also divided by sample size <code class="reqn">N</code>.
For each information criterion, a robust version is calculated if raw data is available.
Their corresponding names are <code>raic</code>, <code>raic3</code>, <code>rcaic</code>, <code>rbic</code>, <code>rabic</code>, and <code>rhbic</code> with &quot;r&quot; standing for &quot;robust&quot;.
These robust criteria use the Satorra-Bentler scaling factor for correcting degree of freedom.
For the case of normal data and correctly specified model, the two versions will be the same asymptotically.
</p>
<p>Huang, Chen, and Weng (2017) have study the asymptotic behaviors of <code>aic</code> and <code>bic</code> under penalized estimation.
They show that under suitable conditions, <code>aic</code> can select a model with minimum expected loss and <code>bic</code> can choose the most parsimonious one from models that attain the minimum expected loss.
By the order of penalty term, we may expect: (1) the large sample behaviors of <code>aic3</code> and <code>tic</code> will be similar to <code>aic</code>;
and (2) the asymptotic behaviors of <code>caic</code>, <code>abic</code>, and <code>hbic</code> will be similar to <code>bic</code>.
However, their small-sample performances require further studies.
</p>


<h3>Model Fit Evaluation</h3>

<p>Given a chosen penalty level, we may evaluate the overall model fit by using fit indices.
In the current version, available fit indices for model evaluation are

</p>
</li></ul>

<p>In <span class="pkg">lslx</span>, the baseline model is the model that assumes a diagonal covariance matrix and a saturated mean.
Hence, the baseline model may not be appropriate if users hope to evaluate the goodness-of-fit of mean structure.
</p>
<p>It is also possible to test overall model fit by formal statistical test.
In the current version, statistical tests for likelihood ratio (LR) and root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) can be implemented.
If raw data is available, <span class="pkg">lslx</span> calculates mean-adjusted versions of LR statistic (Satorra &amp; Bentler, 1994) and RMSEA intervals (Brosseau-Liard, Savalei &amp; Li, 2012; Li &amp; Bentler, 2006).
It should be noted that the classical tests may not be valid after penalty level selection because the task of penalty level selection may destroy the sampling distribution of test statistics (see Pötscher, 1991 for discussion).
Valid post model selection inference methods require further development.
</p>


<h3>Coefficient Evaluation</h3>

<p>Given a chosen penalty level, we may evaluate the significance of coefficients (or parameters).
In the current version, standard errors based on the expected/observed Fisher information matrix and the sandwich formula are available (see Yuan &amp; Hayashi, 2006 for discussion).
Because the sandwich formula is generally valid compared to the approaches based on Fisher information, <span class="pkg">lslx</span> uses the sandwich formula as default whenever raw data is available.
Note that sandwich covariance matrix in <span class="pkg">lslx</span> is calculated based on Equation (14) in Yuan and Hayashi (2006) but not Equation (2.12a) in Browne (1984) to accommodate the potential model misspecification.
Again, the significance tests may not be valid after penalty level selection.
After version 0.6.4, several post-selection mehtods are available (Huang, in press), inlcuding PoSI method with Scheffe constant (Berk, Brown, Buja, Zhang, &amp; Zhao, 2013) and Polyhedral method (Lee, Sun, Sun, &amp; Taylor, 2016).

<p><code>$new()</code> initializes a new object of <code>lslx</code> R6 class for fitting semi-confirmatory structural equation modeling (SEM).
In most cases, a new <code>lslx</code> object is initialized by supplying <code>model</code> and <code>data</code>.
For details of syntax for model specification, see the section of <em>Model Syntax</em>.
By default, types of response variables (<code>numeric</code> versus <code>ordered</code>) will be infered according to the imported <code>data.frame</code>.
If users hope to transform variables types in <code>lslx</code>, <code>numeric_variable</code> and <code>ordered_variable</code> can be used. 
When multi-group analysis is desired, argument <code>group_variable</code> should be given to specify what variable is used for labeling group.
Argument <code>reference_group</code> can be used to set reference group.
Note that if some group is set as reference, the coefficients in other groups will represent increments from the reference.
When the missingness of data depends on some other variables, <code>auxiliary_variable</code> can be used to specify auxiliary variables for estimate saturated moments.
For details of missing data, see the section of <em>Missing Data</em>.
If raw data is not available, <code>lslx</code> also supports initialization via sample moments.
In that case, <code>sample_cov</code> and <code>sample_size</code> are required.
If <code>sample_mean</code> is missing under moment initialization, it is assumed to be zero.

<p><b>Details</b>
</p>
<p>Set-related methods include several member functions that can be used to modify the initialized model specification.
Like most encapsulation objects, set-related function is used to modify the inner members of object.
So far, the set-related methods are all established to modify the model.
The data are protected without any modification.
</p>
<p><code>$free_coefficient()</code> / <code>$penalize_coefficient()</code> / <code>$fix_coefficient()</code> sets the coefficient named <code>name</code> as FREE / PENALIZED / FIXED with starting value <code>start</code>.
In the case of single group analysis, argument <code>name</code> can be replaced by relations, i.e., the group name can be omitted.
</p>
<p><code>$free_directed()</code> / <code>$penalize_directed()</code> / <code>$fix_directed()</code> sets all the regression coefficients from variables in <code>right</code> to variables in <code>left</code> at groups in <code>group</code> as FREE / PENALIZED / FIXED.
</p>
<p><code>$free_undirected()</code> / <code>$penalize_undirected()</code> / <code>$fix_undirected()</code> sets all the covariances among variables in <code>both</code> at groups in <code>group</code> as FREE / PENALIZED / FIXED.
Note that this method all always not modify the variance of variables specified in <code>both</code>.
</p>
<p><code>$free_block()</code> / <code>$penalize_block()</code> / <code>$fix_block()</code> sets all the parameters belonging to <code>block</code> at <code>group</code> with <code>type</code> as FREE / PENALIZED / FIXED.
</p>
<p><code>$free_heterogeneity()</code> / <code>$penalize_heterogeneity()</code> / <code>$fix_heterogeneity()</code> sets every target coefficient as FREE / PENALIZED / FIXED.
A target coefficient should satisfy that (1) it belongs to <code>block</code> at <code>group</code>, and
(2) it has either free or penalized reference component.
The method is only available in the case of multi-group analysis with specified reference group.
</p>
<p>Inside <code>lslx</code> object, every coefficient (or parameter) has its own name and belongs to some block.
</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The coefficient name is constructed by a relation and a group name.
A relation is defined by combining a left variable name, an operator, and a right variable name.
For example, <code>"y1&lt;-f1"</code> is a relation to represent the coefficient from <code>"f1"</code> to <code>"y1"</code>.
Note that in relation we only use operators <code>"&lt;-"</code> and <code>"&lt;-&gt;"</code>.
<code>"-&gt;"</code> is illegal and no distinction between <code>"="</code> and <code>"~"</code> are made.
In multi-group analysis cases, a coefficient name requires explicitly specifying group name.
For example, <code>"y1&lt;-f1/G1"</code> is the parameter name for the path coefficient from <code>"f1"</code> to <code>"y1"</code> in group <code>"G1"</code>.

<li>
<p>Block is defined by the types of left variable and right variable, and the operator.
In <span class="pkg">lslx</span>, <code>"y"</code> is used to indicate observed response, <code>"f"</code> is used for latent factor, and <code>"1"</code> is for intercept.
Hence, <code>"y&lt;-f"</code> is the block that contains all the coefficients from latent factors to observed responses.
There are 10 possible distinct blocks: <code>"f&lt;-1"</code>, <code>"y&lt;-1"</code>, <code>"f&lt;-f"</code>, <code>"f&lt;-y"</code>, <code>"y&lt;-f"</code>, <code>"y&lt;-y"</code>, <code>"f&lt;-&gt;f"</code>, <code>"f&lt;-&gt;y"</code>, <code>"y&lt;-&gt;f"</code>, and <code>"y&lt;-&gt;y"</code>

<p>Arguments in set-related methods may rely on the naming rule of coefficent name and block to modify model specification.

<p><b>Details</b>
</p>
<p>Many extract-related methods are defined to obtain quantities that can be used for further SEM applications or model diagnosis.
Some of these quantities only depend on data (e.g., saturated sample covariance matrix), but some of them relies on a penalty level (e.g., gradient of objective function).
An optimal penalty level can be determined by specifying a <code>selector</code> or a combination of <code>gamma</code> and <code>lambda</code>.
When implementing fit-related methods, <code>lslx</code> only records necessary results for saving memory.
Therefore, the extract-related methods not only extract objects but may possibly re-compute some of them.
If the extracted quantity is a function of model coefficients, note that fixed coefficient is still considered as a valid variable.
For example, the sub-gradient of objective function is calculated by considering both estimated coefficients and fixed coefficients.
Hence, it is not appropriate to use all the elements of the sub-gradient to evaluate the optimality of solution because the values of fixed coefficients are not optimized.
Fortunately, the <code>type</code> argument can be used to choose desired parameters by their types.
