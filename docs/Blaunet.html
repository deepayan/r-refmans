</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr><td><code id="blau_+3A_square.data">square.data</code></td>

<tr><td><code id="blau_+3A_graph">graph</code></td>
<td>

<p>A named edgelist or adjacency matrix. This is required for computing measures which incorporate network information. Relies on the <code>network</code> object from package <code>network</code>.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="blau_+3A_directed.el">directed.el</code></td>

<td>

<p>Indicates the column which holds node (individual) identifiers. May be the column number or column name.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="blau_+3A_weights">weights</code></td>
<td>

<p>A column with weights for each observation. May be the column number or column name. In the absence of specification, all weights are assumed to be equal (and are set to 1). Weights are used in a weighted standard deviation calculation.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="blau_+3A_ecology.ids">ecology.ids</code></td>
<td>

<p>Indicates the column which holds ecology identifiers. May be the column number or column name.

<p>A way to manually exclude columns from automatic incorporation as membership or demographic columns. May be a vector of column names as strings, or a vector of column numbers. Useful for larger datasets where the vast majority of columns are included.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="blau_+3A_dimensions">dimensions</code></td>
<td>

<p>Indicates the columns which hold Blau parameter information. May be a vector of column names as strings, or a vector of column numbers. In the absence of specification, all non-binary columns that are not used for other purposes will be assumed to be demographic variables.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="blau_+3A_memberships">memberships</code></td>
<td>

<p>Indicates the columns which hold organizational membership information.  May be a vector of column names as strings, or a vector of column numbers. In the absence of specification, all binary columns that are not used for other purposes will be assumed to be membership indicators.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="blau_+3A_complete.cases">complete.cases</code></td>
<td>

<p>Defaults to <code>FALSE</code>. A boolean setting indicating whether all rows with at least one missing value should be dropped before proceeding with calculations. Otherwise, the program will be &ldquo;greedy&rdquo; about determining niche boundaries, using as much information as possible.</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The most common raw data format is a <code>.csv</code> file that contains ecology identifiers, node identifiers, blau parameters, and memberships, among other variables. <b>Note:</b> Unless told otherwise, this function will automatically assume binary columns are memberships and non-binary columns are parameters. Manual specification of memberships or parameters will overwrite this auto-detection. This makes it easy to work with relatively large data without specificing dozens of columns.
</p>
<p>The vast majority of configuration takes place when calling the blau function. As such, it is essential that the user understand how choices made here impact the operation of subsequent functions. The easiest way to get started is to determine which of the four optional parameters&mdash;node identifiers (<code>node.ids</code>), ecology identifiers (<code>ecology.ids</code>), weights (<code>weights</code>), and relational data (<code>graph</code>)&mdash;are present in your dataset and will be used for analysis. These should be specified by indicating their locations with the appropriate function argument, and the <code>blau</code> function will automatically assume all other columns are either membership or demographic columns. If there are columns to be excluded from analysis, they can be specified with the exclude parameter. This type of setup is appropriate for the vast majority of datasets.
</p>
<p>It is important to remember that any information incorporated into the <code>blau</code> object through this function will be used when calling subsequent functions. For instance, if your analysis does not require weights, but they are provided in the dataset, they should be explicitly excluded with the <code>exclude</code> argument.
</p>
<p>If ecology identifiers are provided, all subsequent analyses will automatically proceed on a by-ecology level (unless specified explicitly in subsequent functions).
</p>
<p>With network information, the most important consideration is that node identifiers are properly indicated and may be matched up with node identifications provided with the <code>node.ids</code> parameter. Adjacency matrix or edgelist input formats are both converted to an <code>network</code> object. The preferred format is a named edgelist (two columns, with node names in each row indicating an edge). 
</p>
<p>If node names are <code>numeric</code> rather than <code>character</code>, they should still be specified in the input function with <code>node.ids</code> and a network should correctly indicate node identifiers.
</p>
<p>If complete.cases is <code>FALSE</code> (the default option), we automatically use as much information as possible to compute niche boundaries. For example, an individual may have missing Blau parameter information for a certain dimension. Under the default settings, we still utilize the user's other demographic information to compute niche boundaries. If compleCases is specified as <code>TRUE</code>, then only observations with no missing values along all elements in the input matrix will be utilized in determining boundaries.
</p>

Calculate and Analyze Blau statuses for Measuring Social Distance
</h2><span id='topic+blaunet'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Blaunet package calculates and analyzes Blau statuses for quantifying social distance between individuals belonging to organizations. Blaunet works by considering individuals placed in an abstract social space, defined by various user-provided variables. Organizations recruit from an area (or &ldquo;niche&rdquo;) in social space. Blaunet analyzes where organizations recruit from, the positions users occupy in this competitive environment, and substantial features of the connections between individuals.

<p><b>1. Purpose of software</b>: The purpose of the software is to perform Blau status analysis, which is an analytic framework that allows one to describe how organizational competition affects micro-level processes. It relies on abstractly conceptualizing individuals as inhabiting a k-dimensional euclidean space formed by k variables.
</p>
<p><b>2. Defintions</b> 
</p>
<p><b>a. Blau Space</b>:  A k-dimensional space, where socio-demographic characteristics such as age, years of education, or income are used to structure the dimensions of the space. These characteristics are referred to as Blau parameters. Individuals are then populated in this space based on their attributes on the specified demographic dimensions. Each person is represented by a set of k coordinates, which correspond to the person's attributes on the Blau parameters.
</p>
<p><b>b. Niche</b>: The area of the Blau space from which organizations recruit members. The niches are calculated based on the Blau parameters of individuals already in the organization. Organizations compete with each other both by recruiting members already inhabiting their niches and by expanding their niches. The extent to which niches overlap reflects competition between organizations for members. The niche for an organization is a hypercube in k-dimensional space.
</p>
<p><b>c. Blau Status</b>: Denotes a person's (or a relationship's) position in the organizational competitive ecology relative to the competing niches. Blau statuses that characterize a person's position in the ecology are called nodal blau statuses. Computing nodal statuses only requires membership information. Blau statuses that characterize a relationship's position in the ecology are called dyadic blau statuses. Computing dyadic statuses requires not only membership, but also sociometric network information. 
</p>
<p><b>d. Ecology</b>: A relatively bound system where organizations compete for members. The system is bound by spatial or other considerations. For example, a school where extracurricular clubs compete for members could represent a single ecology. A second school in another town may form a second ecology, as the second schools clubs do not recruit at the first school. A town where different voluntary organizations compete for members can also represent a single ecology. By assumption, organizations can only compete within an ecology. For instance, an Elks group can compete with a church group so long as the two draw members from the same community. However, much like the boundary specification problem (Laumann, Marsden, Prensky 1983) in social networks, ecologies are difficult to precisely define.
</p>
<p><b>3. Data Structure</b>: Several types of information are necessary or helpful to specific the Blau statuses of individuals: 
<b>i.)</b> Individual ID: this variable identifies the individuals in the dataset
</p>
<p><b>ii.)</b> Ecology ID: indicates how individuals are partitioned into ecologies (e.g. schools, cities, etc.).
</p>
<p><b>iii.)</b> Blau Parameters: continuous demographic characteristics of individuals that the researcher finds relevant to determining similarity among individuals (e.g. age, SES, BMI). This set of variables is used to construct the niches that structure Blau space.
</p>
<p><b>iv.)</b> Organizational Memberships: the membership of individuals in specific organizations (e.g. charitable organizations, religious groups, fraternal organizations). This set of variables is used to construct the niches that individuals occupy.
</p>
<p><b>v.)</b> Network data: the sociometric network information of individuals. This information is used to compute dyadic blau statuses, although is not necessary for other status computations.
</p>
<p><b>vi.)</b> Weights (optional): for data that was sampled from a population and where Blau  parameters need to be adjusted by weights.
</p>
<p><b>4. Note:</b> We've made every effort to make sure that that the program works correctly. However, we advise caution as we are unable to test on every type of dataset. If anything looks anomalous, please let us know at the maintenance email address below.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>All measures are at the edge-level of analysis and characterize ties/dyads rather than individuals/nodes.
</p>
<p>Euclidean Distance: is the euclidean distance between two nodes in the edge
</p>
<p>Mahalanobis Distance: is euclidean distance standardized by the unit of measurement
</p>
<p>Co-nichers: are ties that are located within the same niche. A 0 indicates that both nodes of the tie do not share any niche in common. A 1 indicates that both nodes of the tie belong to only one common niche. A number of 2 or more indicates that the nodes of the tie share more than 1 common niche. 
</p>
<p>Co-outsiders: is an indicator variable that denotes ties where both nodes do not belong to any niche. 
</p>
<p>Straddlers: is an indicator variable that denotes ties where one node belongs to at least one niche and the other node does not belong to any niche. 
</p>
<p>Spanners: is an indicator variable that denotes ties where one node belongs to one niche and the other node belongs to a different niche.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The purpose of this function is to get a better sense of how the niches are organized within each ecology. 
</p>
<p>The rows represent niches. The number of rows corresponds to the number of niches. 
</p>
<p>Computes five measures:
</p>
<p>OrgMem: computes how many people are in each of the organizations that structure the niche.

<td>

<p>Defaults to <code>FALSE</code>. If set to <code>TRUE</code>, treats all individuals as in the same ecology, even if ecology identifiers (<code>ecology.ids</code>) have been specified.</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Creates niches for each organization within each ecology. Niches are hypercubes in euclidean space that define the area a member-seeking organization is likely to recruit members from. Consider a given organization: its members have various traits such as age, income, and work experience. We find the mean point in n-dimensional space for an organization. For each dimension, we extend <code>dev.range*SD</code> out from this mean in both positive and negative directions. Doing this for each dimension defines the niche for the given organization within the given ecology.
</p>
<p>Once we define niche dimensions, we examine the demographic information for each individual and indicate whether the individual is inside the niche. This information is stored in the matrix <code>blauObject$isInNiche</code>.
</p>
<p>Each ecology may have different niche boundaries for a given organization. This heterogeneity is important for examining how different organizations recruit in different ecologies (e.g. cities, schools, etc.).

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The three measures computed provide information on each individual across all niches.
</p>
<p>TotalOrgs: Total number of organizations the person is in. The lower bound is 0 and the upper bound is the maximum number of organizations in the ecology. 
</p>
<p>Nicher:  Provides information on how many niches the person is in or how many organizations are competing for that individual (irrespective of actual membership).  The value of 0 indicates that a person in an outsider (is not in any niche). The value of 1 indicates that the person is an exclusive nicher, suggesting an organizational monopoly. A value of 2 or more indicates that the person is a manifolder or belongs to multiple niches and is a potential recruit for multiple organizations. 
</p>
<p>Niches: a string indicating which niches the individual belongs to and containing niche column numbers separated by spaces. This provides an at-a-glance format and may be easily split up with string parsing functions.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This provides information about the focal membership for each individual.
</p>
<p>FocNicher: Provides information on how many niches a person is in including the focal niche (it may also be accessed manually by <code>object$isInNiche</code>). A value of 0 indicates a person is not in any niche. A value of 1 indicates the person is only in the focal niche. A value of more than 1 indicates the person is in more than the focal niche. ((it may be more intuitive if we use two columns: in focal niche and total # niches))

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function requires sociometric network data and identifies ties that bridge niches. The preferred format is a named edgelist, although an adjacency matrix with properly named rows and columns is also acceptable. Network information will be matched to organization and demographic information by these names.
</p>
<p>For individuals <code>i</code> and <code>j</code> in niches <code>alpha</code> and <code>beta</code>, if individual <code>i</code> is in niche <code>alpha</code> and individual <code>j</code> is in niche <code>beta</code>, and <code>i</code> and <code>j</code> have an edge between them, then <code>i</code> spans to niche <code>beta</code> and <code>j</code> spans to niche <code>alpha</code>. However, if <code>i</code> is in both niche <code>alpha</code> and niche <code>beta</code>, <code>i</code> would not span to <code>beta</code> because <code>i</code> is already in niche <code>beta</code>.
