<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Model that assesses daily exposure to air pollution, taking into account several dynamic variables. The essence of this model focuses on integrating data related to daily routines, people's mobility and hourly concentrations of air pollutants. Users must provide accurate details about their daily activities, including information about their residence, activity sites, activity schedules, and the commuting. A key element is the use of the TomTom API, which determinated urban mobility patterns for a more complete view of travel in urban environments. The atmospheric pollutants considered in this model include are the criteria pollutants: carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), particulate matter (PM), ozone (O3) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) due to their potential health impacts. Additionally, a model with fixed variables is included, where it is assumed that a person is present 24 hours at a location (typically at home). The purpose of this function is to compare both methodologies and identify more realistic ways to estimate exposure and understand potential health effects.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>From the request for information on route alternatives returned by trajectories_tomtom, this function has the purpose  to classify and shows the routes obtained in three different formats. After obtaining the six route alternatives, the next step involves classifying the route types into: i) 'faster' (according to travel time - faster); ii) 'shorter' (according to travel distance - short); iii) more polluted and less polluted (according to the concentrations for the specified day and time - 'morepol' and 'lesspol'); iv) higher and lower exposure (according to the concentrations and the duration of each route - 'moreexpos' and 'lessexpos'). The routes can be the same for different alternatives. For instance, the most polluted route may coincide with the fastest route. The function is used by total_exposure to obtain each of the trips taken during the day by an individual.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Returns the specified object in the output parameter:
</p>
<table role = "presentation">
<tr><td><code>df</code></td>
<td>
<p>it provides information in a dataframe objset about the route. The variables include: alternative; ID, long, lat, departureTime, arrivalTime, lengthInMeters trafficLengthInMeters, travelMode, trafficDelayInSeconds, travelTimeInSeconds, liveTrafficIncidentsTravelTimeInSeconds, historicTrafficTravelTimeInSeconds, noTrafficTravelTimeInSeconds daily_pol_value_mean, exposure_value_mean and type</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>plot</code></td>
<td>
<p>It returns an object of type leaflet and htmlwidget corresponding to an interactive map where it is possible to visualize the streets through which each of the alternatives will pass</p>
</td></tr>

</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Allows for the configuration of colors for pollutant grids based on the EPA's Air Quality Index (AQI) ranges, determining potential effects of exposure to specific atmospheric pollutants. Within the package are functions like total_exposure, traditional_model and alternative_trajectories, that facilitate visualizing outputs via an interactive leaflet map. The map_color function uses pollutant concentration grids and, depending on the chosen function mention, generates a new grid with additional fields where colors and ranges are set for potential pollutant effects. Subsequently, each of the mentioned functions takes these columns and returns an interactive map with colored grids. The categories could be string values like &quot;Good&quot;, &quot;Moderate&quot;,&quot;Unhealthy for sensible groups&quot;, &quot;Unhealthy&quot;, &quot;Very Unhealthy&quot;, &quot;Hazardous&quot;. The field colors is a string with the HEX color code like &quot;#abdda4&quot;, &quot;#f8fd66&quot;, &quot;#fdde61&quot;, &quot;#d74a4c&quot;, &quot;#b687ba&quot;,&quot;#590e632&quot;
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Returns the input grid with two additional fields named categories and color which are utilized in the total_exposure, traditional_model and alternative_trajectories functions to visualize data in interactive Leaflet maps. </p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Seeks to obtain traffic information from the Tom-Tom API, by requesting six different travel alternatives based on the day, time, mode of transport, and the origin and destination points provided by the user.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Returns a dataframe with 14 fields, where: 1) ID corresponds to an identification number of each of the 6 alternatives provided by the API;  2) long and 3) lat correspond to the latitude and longitude of all the points along the route taken; 4) departureTime departure time from the origin to destination; 5) arrivalTime arrival time at the destination; 6) &quot;alternative&quot; name of the alternatives, from alternative_1 to alternative_6. he next fields contain information about the travel. Please see de documentation of Tom-Tom API of: &quot;trafficLengthInMeters&quot;, &quot;travelMode&quot;, &quot;trafficDelayInSeconds&quot;,] &quot;travelTimeInSeconds&quot;, &quot;liveTrafficIncidentsTravelTimeInSeconds&quot;, &quot;historicTrafficTravelTimeInSeconds&quot;, &quot;noTrafficTravelTimeInSeconds&quot;
