<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The sample size for a particular subgroup is limited. Therefore, it is difficult to accurately estimate treatment-related effects in each experiment arm separately, and the corresponding subgroup power may also be insufficient. Given that all candidate combination therapies in each arm consist of investigational drugs, it is justifiable to leverage information from specific subgroups across arms. Specifically, we adopt the Bayesian hierarchical model and assign half-cauchy prior distributions to the the standard deviation parameters.
