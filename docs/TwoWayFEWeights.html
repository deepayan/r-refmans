fixed effects regressions with several treatments, those in de Chaisemartin

second paper when other_treatments is specified. When it is specified, the
command reports the number and sum of positive and negative weights
attached to the treatment, but it does not report the summary measures of
the regression's robustness to heterogeneous treatment effects, as these
summary measures are no longer applicable when the regression has several
treatment variables. The command also reports the weights attached to the
other treatments. The weights reported by the command are those in
Corollary 1 in de Chaisemartin &amp; D'Haultfoeuille (2020b). See de

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function estimates the weights attached to the two-way fixed
effects regressions studied in de Chaisemartin &amp; D'Haultfoeuille (2020a),
as well as summary measures of these regressions' robustness to
heterogeneous treatment effects.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list object with an additional &quot;twowayfeweights&quot; class attribute to
enable bespoke print (and other) methods. Included among the slots of the
returned list object is a data frame containing the weights attached to
each group*time cell.
</p>


<h3>FAQ</h3>

<p><em>Q. How can one interpret the summary measures of the regression's robustness to heterogeneous treatment effects?</em>
</p>
<p>When the two-way fixed effects regression has only one treatment variable, the command reports two summary measures of the robustness of the treatment coefficient beta to treatment heterogeneity across groups and over time.  The first one is defined in point (i) of Corollary 1 in de Chaisemartin &amp; D'Haultfoeuille (2020a). It corresponds to the minimal value of the standard deviation of the treatment effect across the treated groups and time periods under which beta and the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) could be of opposite signs. When that number is large, this means that beta and the ATT can only be of opposite signs if there is a lot of treatment effect heterogeneity across groups and time periods. When that number is low, this means that beta and the ATT can be of opposite signs even if there is not a lot of treatment effect heterogeneity across groups and time periods. The second summary measure is defined in point (ii) of Corollary 1 in de Chaisemartin &amp; D'Haultfoeuille (2020a).  It corresponds to the minimal value of the standard deviation of the treatment effect across the treated groups and time periods under which beta could be of a different sign than the treatment effect in all the treated group and time periods.
</p>
<p><em>Q. How can I tell if the first summary measure is high or low?</em>
</p>
<p>Assume that the first summary measure is equal to x. How can you tell if x is a low or a high amount of treatment effect heterogeneity? This is not an easy question to answer, but here is one possibility.  Let us assume that the treatment effects of (g,t) cells are drawn from a uniform distribution. Then, to have that the mean of that distribution is 0 while its standard deviation is x, the treatment effects should be uniformly distributed on the <code style="white-space: pre;">&#8288;[-sqrt(3)x,sqrt(3)x]&#8288;</code> interval. Then, you can ask yourself: is it reasonable to assume that some (g,t) cells have a treatment effect as large as <code style="white-space: pre;">&#8288;sqrt(3)x&#8288;</code>, while other cells have a treatment effect as low as <code style="white-space: pre;">&#8288;-sqrt(3)x&#8288;</code>? If the answer is negative (you think that it is not reasonable to assume that the treatment effect will exceed the <code style="white-space: pre;">&#8288;+/-sqrt(3)x&#8288;</code> bounds for some (g,t) cells), this means that the uniform distribution of treatment effects compatible with an ATT of 0 and a standard deviation of x seems implausible to you. Then, you can consider that the command's first summary measure is high, and that it is unlikely that beta and the ATT are of a different sign. Conversely, if the answer is positive (you believe that the treatment effect might exceed the bounds for some (g,t) cells), it may not be unlikely that beta and the ATT are of a different sign.
</p>
<p>The previous sensitivity exercise assumes that treatment effects follow a uniform distribution. You may find it more reasonable to assume that they are, say, normally distributed. Then you can conduct the following, similar exercise. If the treatment effects of (g,t) cells are drawn from a normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation x normal distribution, 95\
</p>
<p><em>Q. How can I tell if the second summary measure is high or low?</em>
</p>
<p>Assume that the second summary measure is equal to x. To fix ideas, let us assume that beta&gt;0. Let us assume that the treatment effects of (g,t) cells are drawn from a uniform distribution. Then, one could have that those effects are all negative, with a standard deviation equal to x, for instance if they are uniformly drawn from the <code style="white-space: pre;">&#8288;[-2sqrt(3)x,0]&#8288;</code>. Then, you can ask yourself: is it reasonable to assume that some (g,t) cells have a treatment effect as low as <code style="white-space: pre;">&#8288;-2sqrt(3)x&#8288;</code>? If the answer is negative (you are not willing to assume that some (g,t) cells have a treatment effect lower than <code style="white-space: pre;">&#8288;-2sqrt(3)x)&#8288;</code>, this means that the uniform distribution of treatment effects compatible with sign reversal and a standard deviation of x seems implausible to you. Then, you can consider that the command's second summary measure is high, and that sign reversal is unlikely.  If the treatment effects of (g,t) cells are all negative, they cannot follow a normal distribution, so we do not discuss that possibility here.
