<p>Overview: The heatex package calculates heat storage in the body and the components of heat exchange (conductive, convective, radiative, and evaporative) between the body and the environment during physical activity based on the principles of partitional calorimetry. The program enables heat exchange calculations for a range of environmental conditions when wearing various clothing ensembles. An example dataset is provided with the heatex package to inform users about the required inputs. Users should check that the variable 'ArAD' has the correct ratio of the body area exposed to radiation versus the total body surface area. The ArAD ratio included in the released version of the package is 0.70 for a seated posture, the relevant ratio for a standing posture is 0.73. The function 'heatex' performs the heat exchange calculations and sends output data to a dataframe named 'results'. 
</p>
<p>Following is the list of data variables that are needed to run the heatex function in the required order of the arguments:
1. time = Total time for physical activity in minutes.
2. workrate = The work rate (power output) of the activity in watts.
3. ht = Subject height in centimetres.
4. wt = Subject body mass in kilograms (to calculate the body surface area, usual body mass).
5. bmi = Subject body mass before commencing physical activity in kilograms.
6. bmf = Subject body mass after physical activity in kilograms.
7. fluidfood = Fluid and food consumption during the physical activity.
8. urinefaeces = Urine and faeces loss during the physical activity.
9. sweat = Dripped sweat in grams.
10.tci = Initial body core temperature in degrees celsius.
11.tcf = Final body core temperature in degrees celsius.
12.tski = Initial skin temperature in degrees celsius.
13.tskf = Final skin temperature in degrees celsius.
14.vo2 = Oxygen consumption in litres per minute.
15.rer = Respiratory exchange ratio.
16.tdb = Dry bulb temperature of the environment in degrees celsius.
17.tg = Black globe temperature in degrees celsius.
18.va = Air velocity in metres per second.
19.pa = Ambient water vapour pressure in mmHg.
20.icl = Intrinsic clothing insulation in m2.oC.W-1.

</p>
<p>4. Partitional Calorimetry Equations
</p>
<p>4.1 Calculation of the energy equivalent of oxygen, EE

</p>
<p>4.2 Calculation of metabolic free energy production, M
(modified from Parsons,1993)
M (W.m-2) = (((EE x VO2 x t)/(t x 60))/AD)
where EE = energy equivalent (J.L O2-1), VO2 = oxygen consumption (L.min-1), t = exercise time (min) and AD = body surface area (m2).
</p>
<p>4.3 Calculation of mechanical efficiency, n

</p>
<p>4.4 Calculation of internal heat production, H

where M = metabolic free production (W.m-2), n= mechanical efficiency and AD is the body surface area (m2).
</p>
<p>4.5 Calculation of body heat storage, S

where 3474= average specific heat of body tissue (J.kg-1.oC-1), wt= body mass (kg), Tb = mean body temperature (oC), t = exercise time (s) and AD = body surface area (m2).
</p>
<p>4.6 Calculation of heat transfer via conduction, K
K (W.m-2) = AD x ((Tsk - Tcl)/Rc)
where AD = body surface area (m2), Tsk = mean skin temperature (K), Tcl = mean fabric temperature (K), and Rc = intrinsic thermal resistance of clothing (m2.K.W-1).
</p>
<p>4.7 Calculation of heat transfer via radiation, R
(adapted from McIntyre, 1980)
R (W.m-2) = E.sigma.fcl.feff.(Ts4 - Tr4)
where E = emittance from the outer surface of a clothed body (0.97), sigma = Stefan-Boltzmann constant (5.67 x 10-8 W.m-2.K-4), fcl = clothing area factor (ND), feff = effective radiation areaof a clothed body (0.71), and Ts = surface temperature of the body (oC) and Tr = mean radiant temperature (oC).

</p>
<p>4.10 Calculation of the maximal evaporative capacity of the environment, Emax
(from McIntyre, 1980)

</p>
<p>4.13 Calculation of heat transfer by sweat evaporation from the skin surface, Esw
Esw (W.m-2) = ((((wtinitial - wtfinal)-(fluid/food intake+urine/faeces loss)-((0.019 x VO2 x (44-Pa)) x t)))x 2430)/((t x 60) x AD)
where wt = body mass (g), fluid/food intake and urine/faeces loss are in grams, the expression 0.019 x VO2 x (44-Pa) accounts for respiratory weight loss in g.min-1 (Mitchell et al., 1972), VO2= oxygen uptake in L.min-1, t = observation time (min), and AD = body surface area (m2).
</p>
<p>4.14 Calculation of heat transfer via evaporation from the skin surface, Esk
Esk (W.m-2) = Ed + Esw

</p>
<p>4.15 Calculation of heat transfer via the respiratory tract, Eres+Cres
(from McIntyre, 1980)
Eres+Cres (W.m-2) = (0.0014 x M x (Tex-Tdb))+(0.0017 x M x (58.7-Pa))
where M = metabolic heat production (W.m-2), Tex= expired air temperature (assumed to be 34oC if Tex is not measured directly), Tdb = dry bulb temperature (oC), and Pa= partial water vapor pressure of ambient air (mmHg).
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>The heatex function uses the following constants. The user should revise these as needed.
</p>
<p>The latent heat of evaporation of sweat (variable 'l') is 2430 J.g-1.
The permeance coefficient of the skin (variable 'm.coef') is 1.694 x 10-4 g.s-1.m-2.mmHg-1.
Stefan-Boltzmann constant (variable 'sigma') is 5.67 x 10-8 W.m-2.K-4.
Emittance from the outer surface of a clothed body (variable 'E') is 0.97.
Effective radiation area of a clothed body (variable 'feff') is 0.71.
</p>
<p>The following variables should be changed in the function to be specific to the test conditions.
</p>
<p>The ratio of the body area exposed to radiation versus the total body surface area (variable 'ArAd') should be 0.70 for a seated posture and 0.73 for a standing posture. ArAD is set to 0.70 in the released heatex package.
</p>
<p>If the test subject is clothed, the final skin temperature variable ('tskf') should be changed to the temperature of the clothing ('tcl') in the calculation of the heat transfer via radiation (r). Similarly, the 'tskf' variable in the calculation of the heat transfer via convection should be changed to the 'tcl_K' variable.</p>

</p>

where 3474= average specific heat of body tissue (J.kg-1.oC-1), wt= body mass (kg), Tb = mean body temperature (oC), t = exercise time (s) and AD = body surface area (m2).
</p>
<p>4.6 Calculation of heat transfer via conduction, K

</p>
<p>4.7 Calculation of heat transfer via radiation, R
(adapted from McIntyre, 1980)
R (W.m-2) = E.sigma.fcl.feff.(Ts4 - Tr4)

</p>
<p>4.10 Calculation of the maximal evaporative capacity of the environment, Emax
(from McIntyre, 1980)
Emax (W.m-2) = fpcl x he x (Ps - Pa)
where fpcl = permeation efficiency factor of clothing, he = evaporative heat transfer coefficient (W.m-2.kPa-1), Ps = partial water vapor pressure at the skin surface (kPa), and Pa = partial water vapor pressure of ambient air (kPa).
</p>
<p>4.11 Calculation of skin wettedness, w
w = Ereq/ Emax

</p>
<p>4.12 Calculation of evaporative heat transfer via skin diffusion, Ed
(modified from Fanger, 1970)
Ed (W.m-2) = (l.m.(Ps - Pa))
where l = latent heat of evaporation of sweat (2430 J.g-1), m = permeance coefficient of the skin (1.694 x 10-4 g.s-1.m-2.mmHg-1), Ps = partial water vapor pressure at the skin surface (mmHg) and Pa= partial water vapor pressure in ambient air (mmHg)
</p>
<p>4.13 Calculation of heat transfer by sweat evaporation from the skin surface, Esw
Esw (W.m-2) = ((((wtinitial - wtfinal)-(fluid/food intake+urine/faeces loss)-((0.019 x VO2 x (44-Pa)) x t)))x 2430)/((t x 60) x AD)
where wt = body mass (g), fluid/food intake and urine/faeces loss are in grams, the expression 0.019 x VO2 x (44-Pa) accounts for respiratory weight loss in g.min-1 (Mitchell et al., 1972), VO2= oxygen uptake in L.min-1, t = observation time (min), and AD = body surface area (m2).
</p>
<p>4.14 Calculation of heat transfer via evaporation from the skin surface, Esk
Esk (W.m-2) = Ed + Esw
where Ed = heat transfer by skin diffusion (W.m-2) and Esw = heat transfer from sweat evaporation from the skin surface (W.m-2).
</p>
<p>4.15 Calculation of heat transfer via the respiratory tract, Eres+Cres
(from McIntyre, 1980)
Eres+Cres (W.m-2) = (0.0014 x M x (Tex-Tdb))+(0.0017 x M x (58.7-Pa))
where M = metabolic heat production (W.m-2), Tex= expired air temperature (assumed to be 34oC if Tex is not measured directly), Tdb = dry bulb temperature (oC), and Pa= partial water vapor pressure of ambient air (mmHg).
