<td>Rapid satellite data streams in operational applications
    have clear benefits for monitoring land cover, 
    especially when information can be delivered as fast as changing
    surface conditions. Over the past decade,
    remote sensing has become a key tool for monitoring and predicting
    environmental variables by using satellite data. 
    This package presents the main applications in remote sensing for 
    land surface monitoring and land cover mapping (soil, vegetation, water...).

<h3>Description</h3>

<p> cover management factor in RUSLE model (C factor): Many people in     the erosion control industry use the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation       (RUSLE) to estimate soil loss caused by rainfall erosion. The equation          combines the interrelated physical and management parameters of climate,        soils, topography, and land use. The full equation is:
</p>
<p>A = R*K*LS*C*P
</p>
<p>C factor : Cover Management
Cover management is considered by RUSLE through the C factor. The C factor      represents the effect of surface cover and roughness on soil erosion. The       cover factor is the most common factor used to assess the impact of BMPs on     reducing erosion because the C factor represents the effect of land use on      soil erosion (Renard et al., 1997). Erosion control blankets and surface       applied BMPs such as blown straw are represented as C factors within RUSLE.     By definition, C = 1 under standard fallow conditions. As surface cover is      added to the soil, the C factor value approaches zero.
The unitless cover management factor can be determined in different ways.       The     remote sensing data, useful for reconstructing the temporal             variation of C factor. The relationship between the C factor and NDVI is the     same applied to the regional scale that is the following (Knijff et al.,        2000):
</p>
<p>C=exp(2.5* NDVI/1-NDVI)
</p>
<p>And  another equation (Durigon et al., 2014):
</p>
<p>c=[(-1*NDVI+0.5)]

<h3>Description</h3>

<p> Enhanced Built-Up and Bareness Index (EBBI):
The EBBI is a remote sensing index that applies bands of NIR, SWIR, and TIR.    The NIR and SWIR bands are associated with a high contrast level for            detecting built-up and bare land areas In addition, in these bands, there is    an inverse reflectance ratio with respect to detecting built-up or bare land    areas compared to vegetation. Vegetation has a high reflectance in NIR band,    but the reflectance of built-up or bare land in NIR band is low. subtraction    of NIR band  from SWIR band  will result in positive values for built-up and    barren pixels and will result in negative values for vegetation.
In addition, a summation of SWIR band  and TIR band  will result in higher      values pixel for built-up and bare land than for vegetation. The difference     between the subtraction of NIR band  from SWIR band  and the summation of       SWIR band  and TIR band  will result in virtually 0 water pixels as well as     negative values for vegetation and positive values for built-up and barren      pixels. This outcome allows for easy distinguishing between built-up and bare    land areas.EBBI can be calculated as:
</p>
<p>EBBI=SWIR-Red/10*sqrt(SWIR+TIR)

<h2 id='Enhanced+20Vegetation+20Index'>Enhanced Vegetation Index</h2><span id='topic+EVI'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>In areas of dense canopy where the leaf area index (LAI) is high, the NDVI values can be improved by leveraging information in the blue wavelength. Information in this portion of the spectrum can help correct for soil background signals and atmospheric influences. The enhanced vegetation index (EVI) is an 'optimized' vegetation index designed to enhance the vegetation signal with improved sensitivity in high biomass regions and improved vegetation monitoring through a de-coupling of the canopy background signal and a reduction in atmosphere influences. EVI is computed following this equation:
</p>
<p>VALUE = 2.5*(NIR - Red) / (NIR + 6*Red - 7.5*Blue + 1)

<h2 id='Modified+20Soil-Adjusted+20Vegetation+20Index'>Modified Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index</h2><span id='topic+MSAVI'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The modified soil-adjusted vegetation index (MSAVI) is the soil adjusted vegetation index that seek to address some of the limitation of NDVI when applied to areas with a high degree of exposed soil surface. The problem with the original soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) is that it required specifying the soil-brightness correction factor (L) through trial-and-error based on the amount of vegetation in the study area. Not only did this lead to the majority of people just using the default L value of 0.5, but it also created a circular logic problem of needing to know what the vegetation amount/cover was before you could apply SAVI which was supposed to give you information on how much vegetation there was. Qi et al. (1994a) developed the MSAVI to more reliably and simply calculate a soil brightness correction factor.
</p>
<p>MSAVI=(NIR-Red)/(NIR+Red+L)*(1+L)
</p>
<p>where RED is the red band reflectance from a sensor, NIR is the near infrared band reflectance, and L is the soil brightness correction factor. The difference between SAVI and MSAVI, however, comes in how L is calculated. In SAVI, L is estimated based on how much vegetation there is (but it's generally left alone at a compromise of 0.5). MSAVI uses the following formula to calculate L:
</p>
<p>L=2*s*(NIR-Red)*(NIR-s* Red)/(NIR+Red)
</p>
<p>where s is the slope of the soil line from a plot of red versus near infrared brightness values.

<h3>Description</h3>

<p> The Normalized Difference Moisture (Water) Index (NDMI or NDWI) is a satellite-derived index from the Near-Infrared (NIR) and Short Wave Infrared (SWIR) channels. The SWIR reflectance reflects changes in both the vegetation water content and the spongy mesophyll structure in vegetation canopies, while the NIR reflectance is affected by leaf internal structure and leaf dry matter content but not by water content. The combination of the NIR with the SWIR removes variations induced by leaf internal structure and leaf dry matter content, improving the accuracy in retrieving the vegetation water content. The amount of water available in the internal leaf structure largely controls the spectral reflectance in the SWIR interval of the electromagnetic spectrum. SWIR reflectance is therefore negatively related to leaf water content. NDWI is computed using the near infrared (NIR) and the short wave infrared (SWIR) reflectance’s:
</p>
<p>NDMI=(NIR - SWIR) / (NIR + SWIR)

<h2 id='Normalized+20Difference+20Vegetation+20Index'>Normalized Difference Vegetation Index</h2><span id='topic+NDVI'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p> Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) quantifies            vegetation by measuring the difference between near-infrared (which           vegetation strongly reflects) and red light (which vegetation absorbs).       NDVI   always ranges from -1 to +1. But there isn’t a distinct boundary       for each type of land cover. For example, when you have negative values,      it’s highly likely that it’s water. On the other hand, if you have a NDVI      value close to +1, there’s a high possibility that it’s dense green          leaves. But when NDVI is close to zero, there isn’t green leaves and          it could even be an urbanized area.As shown below, Normalized Difference      Vegetation Index (NDVI) uses the NIR and red channels in its formula.
NDVI=NIR-Red/NIR+Red
</p>
<p>The result of this formula generates a value between -1 and +1. If you      have low reflectance (or low values) in the red channel and high             reflectance in the NIR channel, this will yield a high NDVI value. And        vice versa.Overall, NDVI is a standardized way to measure healthy             vegetation. When you have high NDVI values, you have healthier vegetation.     When you have low NDVI, you have less or no vegetation. satellites like       Sentinel-2, Landsat and SPOT produce red and near infrared images.

<h3>Description</h3>

<p> In areas where vegetative cover is low (i.e., &lt; 40 percent)  and     the soil surface is exposed, the reflectance of light in the red and near    -infrared spectra can influence vegetation index values. This is especially     problematic when comparisons are being made across different soil types       that may reflect different amounts of light in the red and near infrared     wavelengths (i.e., soils with different brightness values). The soil          -adjusted vegetation index was developed as a modification of the Normalize    d Difference Vegetation Index to correct for the influence of soil            brightness when vegetative cover is low. The SAVI is structured similar to    the NDVI but with the addition of a “soil brightness correction factor,”
</p>
<p>SAVI=(NIR-Red)/(NIR+Red+L)*(1+L)

<p>The SAVI is structured similar to the NDVI but with the addition of a         “soil brightness correction factor,” where NIR is the reflectance value of       the near infrared band, RED is reflectance of the red band, and L is the        soil brightness correction factor. The value of L varies by the amount or      cover of green vegetation: in very high vegetation regions, L=0; and in         areas with no green vegetation, L=1. Generally, an L=0.5 works well in             most     situations and is the default value used. When L=0, then SAVI =      NDVI.

<h2 id='Topsoil+20Grain+20Size+20Index+20'>Topsoil Grain Size Index</h2><span id='topic+TGSI'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Topsoil Grain Size Index (TGSI): Topsoil Grain Size Index (TGSI) was developed based on the field survey of soil surface spectral reflectance and laboratory analyses of soil grain composition. Even one rainfall can significantly increase the vegetation cover. Thus, NDVI is misinterpret the actual degree of desertification (Xiao et al., 2006). To overcome this problem, Xiao et al. (2006) proposed a new index, topsoil grain size index (TGSI), which is associated with the mechanical composition of topsoil. It indicates the coarsening of topsoil grain size which has a positive correlation with fine sand content (this class of sand is dominated by the finer sizes of sand particle, and somewhat less coarse than either sand or coarse sand) of surface soil texture, as a manifestation of undergoing desertification. The more severe the desertification, the coarser the topsoil grain size composition (grain size refers to the mean or effective diameter of individual mineral grains or particles. A high TGSI value corresponds to an area with high content of fine sand in the topsoil or low content of clay-silt grains. The TGSI can be calculated as:
</p>
<p>TGSI= (Red-Blue)/(Red+Blue+green)
</p>
<p>where R, B, and G are the red, blue, and green bands of the remote sensing data, respectively. TGSI is an index used to detect the texture of the topsoil layer, or grain size. Negative values or those near 0 repre- sent zones with vegetation or water bodies and values near 0.20 indicate high contents of fine sand.
