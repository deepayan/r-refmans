<h3>Description</h3>

<p>An extension for 'NetSurfP-2.0' (Klausen et al. (2019) &lt;doi:10.1002/prot.25674&gt;) which is specifically designed to analyze the results of bottom-up-proteomics that is primarily analyzed with 'MaxQuant' (Cox, J., Mann, M. (2008) &lt;doi:10.1038/nbt.1511&gt;). This tool is designed to process a large number of yeast peptides that produced as a results of whole yeast cell-proteome digestion and provide a coherent picture of secondary structure of proteins.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<dl>
<dt><em><strong>What is <code>ypssc</code>?</strong></em></dt><dd>
<p><strong><code>ypssc</code></strong> is an extension for NetSurfP-2.0 which is specifically designed to analyze the results of bottom-up proteomics that
is primarily analyzed with MaxQuant. We call this tool <em><strong>Yeast Proteome Secondary Structure Calculator</strong></em> (<strong><code>ypssc</code></strong>).
</p>
<hr>

</p>
</li></ol>

<hr>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> NetSurfP
</p>

<ul>
<li><p> NetSurfP-1.0 is a prediction tool for secondary structures using neural network.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> NetSurfP-2.0 is an extension of NetSurfP-1.0 which utilized deep neural network to predict secondary structures with the
accuracy of 85%. In addition to accuracy, this tool presents reduced computational time compared to other methods.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> NetSurfP-2.0 is designed to be user friendly and efficient in calculation time of large number of sequences. In addition to
that the output of the calculation is available in many formats that would make further data analysis even easier.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> NetSurfP-2.0 is available as a web-sever (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetSurfP-2.0/) which can accept up to 4000 sequences
at a time.
</p>
</li></ul>

<dl>
<dt><em><strong>Why this package?</strong></em></dt><dd>
<p>This tool is designed to process large number of yeast peptides that produced as a results of whole yeast cell proteome digestion
and provide a coherent picture of secondary structure of proteins. NetSurfP-2.0 is not designed to do this task.
</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Drawbacks of NetSurfP-2.0</strong>
</p>

<ul>
<li><p> First, NetSurfP-2.0 is not designed to accept as many peptides at once, therefore the process of uploading the sequences and
waiting for the calculations to be complete is extremely time consuming.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Second, even if all sequences uploaded successfully and the results are back, it would be almost impossible to combine the
results that have been produced for each individual peptide  (hundreds of thousands of spread sheets) to get a coherent
picture of the secondary structure of the proteins.
</p>
</li></ul>

<hr>
<p><strong>Advantages of <code>ypssc</code></strong>
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><strong><code>ypssc</code></strong>, on one hand benefits forms the accuracy of NetSurfP-2.0 to calculate secondary structure and on the other hand
address the issue of analyzing so many peptides with NetSurfP-2.0 by eliminating the need for direct analysis of the peptides
from bottom-up proteomics.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Instead of direct analysis of peptides by NetSurfP-2.0 which raises the problem of combining the results of peptides to
proteins, the whole yeast proteome has been analyzed once by NetSurfP-2.0 and kept as Secondary Structure Database for Yeast
Proteome (SSDYP). Then the peptides form the experiment are matched and compared to this database to extract secondary
structure of the peptides.
</p>
</li></ul>

</dd></dl>

<hr>
<dl>
<dt><em><strong>Methodology</strong></em></dt><dd>
<p>The SSDYP contains structural information for all amino acids of whole yeast proteome (Over 3000,000 amino acids) which contains
over 6700 proteins. For a hypothetical protein, the SSDYP contains the ID of the protein, amino acids with numbers and structural
information for each amino acid. Focusing on the hypothetical protein, in the real sample, there are many peptides identified
from the hypothetical protein. <strong><code>ypssc</code></strong> first finds all the peptides that belongs to the hypothetical protein and arrange them
based on the numbers of the amino acids; then it removes the parts of the protein that have been identified more than once in
multiple peptides and collapses the population of identified peptides in the sample into one sequence that represents the
coverage of the hypothetical protein. The result would show that which part of the protein is identified, and which part is
missing. Then, <strong><code>ypssc</code></strong> matches the the sequence that identified in the sample with SSDYP to find the structural information
about amino acids.

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Form bottom-up proteomics data of proteins (peptides), this function determines the sections of proteins (in
percentage) with alpha-helix, structure.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<br />
MaxQuant is a quantitative proteomics software designed to analyze large mass-spectrometric data. The input of MaxQuant is a
raw file (.raw) from high-resolution mass spectrometers. After analysis of the raw file in MaxQuant, the program generates a
folder named “combined”. <br />
<br />
In this folder there is another folder named “txt” which contains many files with text format (.txt). One of the files called
“peptides” which is the input of the ypssc to calculate secondary structures. ypssc has been designed such a way that can
analyzed and extract information regarding the sample regardless of the name that user chosen for the sample.</p>
