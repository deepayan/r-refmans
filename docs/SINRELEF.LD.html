<td>Description:</td>
<td>Implements an approach aimed at assessing the accuracy and
    effectiveness of raw scores obtained in scales that contain locally dependent
    items. The program uses as input the calibration (structural) item estimates
    obtained from fitting extended unidimensional factor-analytic solutions in
    which the existing local dependencies are included. Measures of reliability
    (Omega) and information are proposed at three levels: (a) total score, (b)
    bivariate-doublet, and (c) item-by-item deletion, and  are compared to those
    that would be obtained if all the items had been locally independent. All the
    implemented procedures can be obtained from: (a) linear factor-analytic
    solutions in which the item scores are treated as approximately continuous,
    and (b) non-linear solutions in which the item scores are treated as
    ordered-categorical. A detailed guide can be obtained at the following url.</td>

FIQ database.
</h2><span id='topic+FIQ400'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A database to be used as example in the functions included on <code>SINRELEF.LD</code> package. It is part of the data from the study by Dueñas et al. (2022).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>data("FIQ400")</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 400 observations and 17 variables, ranged between 1 and 4.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The participants in this study were parents of adolescents who were enrolled in secondary school. The parents completed the Spanish adaptation of the Family Involvement Questionnaire-High School Version (FIQ-HS), which assesses parental family involvement in the education of their sons and daughters. More specifically, we have randomly selected 400 participants from this study, and we have used their data in the 17 items of the Home-based activities subscale. These items have 4 response options (rarely, sometimes, often and always). We have chosen this subscale because the study by Dueñas et a. (2022) showed that the error terms of some pairs of items were substantially correlated. According to the authors, this was expected because the corresponding item stems were either very similarly worded or tapped similar (although not identical) content.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>SINRELEF.LD</code> implements a series of procedures developed by the authors of the package, which have two main purposes: the first is to assess the real amount of reliability and information provided by the item and scale scores when the scale contains locally dependent items. The second is to compare the results of the assessment to the results that would have been obtained if all the items had been locally independent.
</p>
<p>The procedures are intended at three score levels. First, at the total score, <code>SINRELEF.LD</code> provides the Omega reliability estimate and the amount of score information obtained taking in to account the local dependencies as well as the estimates obtained if local independence had been assumed. Furthermore, a relative efficiency index that assesses the loss of efficiency of the scores due to the local dependencies is provided. Second, at the bivariate level, for each specified doublet, <code>SINRELEF.LD</code> provides the corresponding relative efficiency estimate. Finally, at the single item level, <code>SINRELEF.LD</code> provides estimates of the change in reliability and relative information if the item was omitted from the scale.
</p>
<p>The indices implemented in the function assume that the items have been calibrated using an extended factor-analytic solution that models the existing local dependencies. So, the input of the function requieres the calibration estimates obtained by fitting a solution of this type (e.g. loadings, residual variances, and residual correlations) to be provided. This type of extended solutions can be obtained from widely available programs such as <code>Mplus</code>, <code>FACTOR</code> or <code>lavaan</code> package. Furthermore, the proposed approach works with solutions obtained from two types of factor-analytic models. First, is the linear model, in which the item scores are treated as approximately continuous. Second, is the non-linear model, based on the underlying variables approach in which the item scores are treated as orderered-categorical.
</p>
<p>Finally, confidence intervals based on the Bollen-Stine empirical approach are proposed for all the indices provided in the package.
