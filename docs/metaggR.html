    According to a phenomenon known as "the wisdom of the crowds," 
    combining point estimates from multiple judges often provides a 
    more accurate aggregate estimate than using a point estimate from
    a single judge. However, if the judges use shared information in 
    their estimates, the simple average will over-emphasize this common
    component at the expense of the judges’ private information. 
    Asa Palley &amp; Ville Satopää (2021) "Boosting the Wisdom of Crowds
    Within a Single Judgment Problem: Selective Averaging Based on Peer Predictions"
    <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Papers.cfm?abstract_id=3504286">https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Papers.cfm?abstract_id=3504286</a> proposes
    a procedure for calculating a weighted average of the judges’ individual
    estimates such that resulting aggregate estimate appropriately combines
    the judges' collective information within a single estimation problem. 
    The authors use both simulation and data from six experimental studies
    to illustrate that the weighting procedure outperforms existing averaging-like
    methods, such as the equally weighted average, trimmed average, and median.
    This aggregate estimate &ndash; know as "the knowledge-weighted estimate" &ndash;
    inputs a) judges' estimates of a continuous outcome (E) and 
    b) predictions of others' average estimate of this outcome (P).  
    In this R-package, the function knowledge_weighted_estimate(E,P) 
    implements the knowledge-weighted estimate. Its use is illustrated
    with a simple stylized example and on real-world experimental data. </td>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Palley and Satopää (2021) conducted an experiment where participants were presented with 36 different pictures
of food from different restaurants and were asked to estimate the total number of calories in these dishes.
Each response involves three steps:
</p>

<ol>
<li> <p><strong>Initial Estimates:</strong> On the first screen the participant was presented with a picture of a meal
and asked <em>How many calories do you think are in this meal?</em>
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>Predictions of Others:</strong> On the second screen the participant saw the same
picture, was reminded of their previous estimate, and given the statement:
<em>We will be showing this picture to other participants as well. Just as we did with
you, we will ask them how many calories they believe are in this meal.</em>
The participant was then asked to predict <em>How many calories do you think that others
will guess on average?</em>
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>Final Estimates:</strong> On the third screen the participant saw the same picture again
and was asked <em>After having reflected on others, what is
your own final best estimate of the number of calories in this meal?</em>
</p>
</li></ol>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Palley and Soll (2019) recruited individuals on Amazon Mechanical Turk and asked them
to estimate the proportion of heads in 100 flips of a biased two-sided coin. The probability
of heads was unknown to the participants, who were told that it could be anywhere between
1% and 99%. Before responding, each judge was shown a sample of flips that all judges saw
(shared information) and another sample of flips that was only seen by that individual or by
a subset of judges (private information). Three information structures were considered: 
</p>

<ol>
<li> <p><strong>Symmetric:</strong> All judges saw their own unique sample of flips.
There are a total of 72 judgment tasks under this condition.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>Nested:</strong> Some judges saw only the shared sample while others saw an 
additional common sample.
There are a total of 24 judgment tasks  under this condition.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>Nested-Symmetric:</strong> Some judges saw only the shared sample while others
saw their own additional sample of flips.
There are a total of 24 judgment tasks  under this condition.
</p>
</li></ol>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Martinie et al. (2020) recruited individuals on Amazon Mechanical Turk and asked them to provide subjective probabilities
of whether various general science statements from U.S. grade school were true or false. 
Problems were classified into five levels of difficulty, with level 1 being the easiest and level 5 being the most difficult. 
For example, one easy problem (level 1) presented the statement <em>Omnivores only eat meat</em>, whereas one 
difficult problem (level 5) presented the statement <em>Sound waves and electromagnetic waves 
are examples of longitudinal waves</em>. 
</p>
<p>The full data have been split into 5 groups based on the difficulty the questions.
</p>

<ol>
<li> <p><code>E_GK_1</code> to <code>E_GK_5</code>: A list of the judges' estimates of the probabilities 
that the statements are true. 
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>P_GK_1</code> to <code>P_GK_5</code>: A list of the judges' predictions of others' average probability estimates. 
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>ID_GK_1</code> to <code>ID_GK_5</code>: A list of the judges' identification numbers. 
These values make it possible to track a judge across different judgment tasks. 
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>THETA_GK_1</code> to <code>THETA_GK_5</code>: Actual outcomes showing whether the statements are true (1) or not (0).
</p>
</li></ol>

<p>The final number in the name of the data set indicates the associated difficulty level.
For instance, <code>E_GK_5</code> holds the probability estimates of the most difficult questions, 
<code>THETA_GK_1</code> holds actual outcomes for the easiest questions, and so on.
The elements of each list correspond to the same question. For instance, the <code class="reqn">j</code>th elements
of <code>THETA_GK_1</code>, <code>E_GK_1</code>, <code>P_GK_1</code>, and <code>ID_GK_1</code> give
the true outcome, vector of probability estimates, vector of predictions of other judges' average probability estimates, 
and vector of identification numbers of the <code class="reqn">j</code>th question with difficulty level 1.

<li><p> Left plot: This is a scatter plot of the judges' estimates against the judges' implied predictions of others. 
This plot includes regression lines both with (solid black) and without (dashed red) the exceptionally influential judges.

The knowledge-weighted estimate is shown both with (black square) and without (red circle) exceptionally influential judges.

The outlier-robust version calculates the influence scores for all 
judges. Each influence score is then compared against <code>cutoff</code> x the
interquartile range of all influence scores. If a judge's influence score is above this quantity, then that judge is 
deemed exceptionally influential. This parameter only has an effect if <code>plotIt</code> has been set to TRUE.</p>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code class="reqn">J</code> vector of influence scores. Intuitively, the influence score of a judge represents the amount by which the 
knowledge-weighted estimate would change if that judge was removed from the crowd. Judges with an exceptionally 
high influence should be inspected. As a default cutoff value, the authors recommend <code class="reqn">7/2</code> times the interquartile range
of the individual judges' influence scores.

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Palley and Soll (2019)  recruited participants through ClearVoice Research and 
Amazon Mechanical Turk to estimate the probability that one team or the other would win 
various games in the 2014, 2015, and 2016 NCAA Division I Men’s Basketball Tournaments. 
The responses for the Round of 64 games and Round of 16 games are treated separately 
because the Round of 64 games happen at the start of the tournament and often involve 
heavily mismatched teams (e.g., a 1 seed versus a 16 seed) while Round of 16 games typically 
involve more evenly matched teams, with implied betting market probabilities closer to 50%.
