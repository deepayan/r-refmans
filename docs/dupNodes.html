<td>Creates a new graph from an existing one, duplicating nodes
    with self-loops. This can be used for a computation of betweenness

<h2 id='betweenness.with.duplicated.nodes'>Computed betweenness of an igraph object that already has duplicated nodes</h2><span id='topic+betweenness.with.duplicated.nodes'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This is an implementation of the method published in the paper &quot;Intra-family links in the analysis of marital networks&quot;, which proposed a duplication of nodes that includes self-loops to get a reflect better (and include all information about) the status of all nodes in the network, computing betweenness ignoring the duplicated nodes.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>betweenness.with.duplicated.nodes(dup.graph)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr><td><code id="betweenness.with.duplicated.nodes_+3A_dup.graph">dup.graph</code></td>
<td>
<p>A graph object that has already duplicated nodes with self-loops. Essentially, it will recognize duplicated nodes as those with a prime at the end. Will not return betweenness value for these (it will be exactly the same as the other one).</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This method computes betweenness centrality in the regular way; it will only return values for the &quot;original&quot; nodes, however.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list with betweenness values indexed by node name</p>


<h3>References</h3>

<p>There are no references for Rd macro <code style="white-space: pre;">&#8288;\insertAllCites&#8288;</code> on this help page.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>library(igraph)
V1 &lt;- c("A", "A","B","C","D","E")
V2 &lt;- c("A", "B","C","D","E","A")
df &lt;- data.frame(V1, V2)

dup.graph &lt;- dup.nodes.from.data.frame(df)

</code></pre>

<hr>
<h2 id='DNSL.betweenness'>Computed betweenness via duplication of nodes with self-loops (Duplicated Nodes with Self Loops)</h2><span id='topic+DNSL.betweenness'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Computes the betweenness of nodes in a graph that includes self-loops directly.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>DNSL.betweenness(df,first.node = "V1",second.node = "V2")
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr><td><code id="DNSL.betweenness_+3A_df">df</code></td>
<td>
<p>A data frame that should include at least two columns with the names of the nodes</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="DNSL.betweenness_+3A_first.node">first.node</code></td>
<td>
<p>The column that indicates the node that's linked</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="DNSL.betweenness_+3A_second.node">second.node</code></td>
<td>
<p>The column that indicates the other node that's linked</p>
</td></tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This method computes betweenness centrality of a social network included in a data frame. Use it when you want to just apply the method to a data set, without using the intermediate graph obtained by duplicating nodes.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list with betweenness values indexed by node name</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This method duplicates nodes with self-loops, and links the duplicated nodes with the original with a weight that is equal to the number of self-loops.
</p>
<p>This can be applied to matrimonial networks where there are marriages among members of the same family, or any other type of network with self-loops, and allows to apply centrality (and other) measures, obtaining a meaningful and more accurate result

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>An igraph object with all nodes with self-loops duplicated. These newly created nodes will have the same name as the original, with a &quot;'&quot; added.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Florentine matrimonial links as an <code>igraph</code> object; it includes marriages as well as commercial links between families as recorded by Padgett and Ansell <cite>padgett1993robust</cite> and published by <cite>Wang2022</cite>. It has been enriched with the Medici family genealogy, adding a single self-loop to the Medici family.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>data("florentine.sn")
</code></pre>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This is an igraph object where vertices are Florentine families, and edges link two families that have some kind of relationship, either matrimonial or commercial.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list that can be used as an igraph object, with noble family names as vertices and edges indicating links
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>Data originally from the Wikipedia page on the Medici family, and the Padgett and Ansell paper.
