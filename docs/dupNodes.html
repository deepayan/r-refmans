<h2 id='betweenness.with.duplicated.nodes'>Computes betweenness of an igraph object that already has duplicated nodes</h2><span id='topic+betweenness.with.duplicated.nodes'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This is an implementation of the method published in the paper &quot;Intra-family links in the analysis of marital networks&quot; (Merelo and Molinari 2024), which proposed a duplication of nodes that includes self-loops to get a reflect better (and include all information about) the status of all nodes in the network, computing betweenness ignoring the duplicated nodes.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>betweenness.with.duplicated.nodes(dup.graph)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr><td><code id="betweenness.with.duplicated.nodes_+3A_dup.graph">dup.graph</code></td>
<td>
<p>A graph object that has already duplicated nodes with self-loops. Essentially, it will recognize duplicated nodes as those with a prime at the end. Will not return betweenness value for these (it will be exactly the same as the other one).</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This method computes betweenness centrality in the regular way for the graph that includes duplicated nodes; it will only return values for the &quot;original&quot; nodes, however.
</p>
<p>This object should be created with the function <code><a href="#topic+dup.nodes.from.data.frame">dup.nodes.from.data.frame</a></code> or <code><a href="#topic+dup.nodes.from.graph">dup.nodes.from.graph</a></code>
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list with betweenness values indexed by node name.</p>

<h2 id='DNSL.betweenness'>Computed betweenness via duplication of nodes with self-loops (Duplicated Nodes with Self Loops)</h2><span id='topic+DNSL.betweenness'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Computes the betweenness of nodes in a graph that includes self-loops directly.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>DNSL.betweenness(df,first.node = "V1",second.node = "V2")
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr><td><code id="DNSL.betweenness_+3A_df">df</code></td>
<td>
<p>A data frame that should include at least two columns with the names of the nodes</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="DNSL.betweenness_+3A_first.node">first.node</code></td>
<td>
<p>The column that indicates the node that's linked</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="DNSL.betweenness_+3A_second.node">second.node</code></td>
<td>
<p>The column that indicates the other node that's linked</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This method computes betweenness centrality of a social network described by a data frame. Use it when you want to just apply the DNSLbetweenness method (Merelo and Molinari 2024) to a data set, without using the intermediate graph obtained by duplicating nodes.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list with betweenness values indexed by node name</p>
