<h3>Overview</h3>

<p><code>did_multiplegt</code> wraps in a single command all the estimators from de Chaisemartin and D'Haultfoeuille.  Depending on the mode argument, this command can be used to call the following estimators.
</p>
<p><a href="DIDmultiplegtDYN.html#topic+did_multiplegt_dyn">did_multiplegt_dyn</a>. In <code>dyn</code> mode, the command computes the DID event-study estimators introduced in de Chaisemartin and D'Haultfoeuille (2024a). This mode can be used both with a binary and staggered (absorbing) treatment and a non-binary treatment (discrete or continuous) that can increase or decrease multiple times. The estimator is also robust to heterogeneous effects of the current and lagged treatments. Lastly, it can be used with data where the panel st is unblanced or more disaggregated than the group level.
</p>
<p><a href="DIDHAD.html#topic+did_had">did_had</a>. In <code>had</code> mode, the command computes the DID estimator introduced in de Chaisemartin and D'Haultfoeuille (2024b). This mode estimates the effect of a treatment on an outcome in a heterogeneous adoption design (HAD) with no stayers but some quasi stayers.
</p>
<p><a href="#topic+did_multiplegt_old">did_multiplegt_old</a>. In <code>old</code> mode, the command computes the DID estimators introduced in de Chaisemartin and D'Haultfoeuille (2020). This mode corresponds to the old version of the did_multiplegt command. Specifically, it can be used to estimate <code class="reqn">DID_M</code>, i.e. the average across <code class="reqn">t</code> and <code class="reqn">d</code> of the treatment effects of groups that have treatment <code class="reqn">d</code> at <code class="reqn">t-1</code> and change their treatment at <code class="reqn">t</code>, using groups that have treatment <code class="reqn">d</code> at <code class="reqn">t-1</code> and <code class="reqn">t</code> as controls. This mode could also be used to compute event-study estimates, but we strongly suggest to use the <code>dyn</code> mode, since it is way faster and includes comprehensive estimation and post-estimation support.

<p>the number of placebo estimators to be estimated. Placebo estimators compare switchers' and non-switchers' outcome evolution before switchers' treatment changes. Under the parallel trends assumption underlying the <code class="reqn">DID_M</code> estimator, the placebo estimators should not significantly differ from 0. The number of placebos requested can be at most equal to the number of time periods in the data minus 2.</p>

<td>
<p>the number of dynamic treatment effects to be estimated. This option should only be used in staggered adoption designs, where each group's treatment is weakly increasing over time, and when treatment is binary. The estimators of dynamic effects are similar to the <code class="reqn">DID_M</code> estimator, except that they make use of long differences of the outcome (e.g. from <code class="reqn">t-1</code> to <code class="reqn">t+1</code>) rather than first differences. The number of dynamic effects requested can be at most equal to the number of time periods in the data minus 2.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="did_multiplegt_old_+3A_threshold_stable_treatment">threshold_stable_treatment</code></td>
<td>
<p>this option may be useful when the treatment is continuous, or takes a large number of values. The DIDM estimator uses as controls groups whose treatment does not change between consecutive time periods.  With a continuous treatment, there may not be any pair of consecutive time periods between which the treatment of at least one group remains perfectly stable. For instance, if the treatment is rainfall and one uses a county <code class="reqn">\times</code> year data set, there is probably not a single county*year whose rainfall is exactly the same as in the same county in the previous year.  Then, one needs to specify the <code>threshold_stable_treatment = #</code> option, with # a positive real number.  For each pair of consecutive time periods, the command will use counties whose rainfall changed in absolute value by less than # as controls. # should be large enough so that there are counties whose rainfall levels change by less than # between two consecutive years, but it should be small enough so that a change in rainfall of # would be unlikely to affect the outcome.</p>

<tr><td><code id="did_multiplegt_old_+3A_recat_treatment">recat_treatment</code></td>
<td>
<p>pools some values of the treatment together when determining the groups whose outcome evolution are compared. This option may be useful when the treatment takes a large number of values, and some very rare in the sample. For instance, assume that treatment D takes the values 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, but few observations have a treatment equal to 2. Then, there may be a pair of consecutive time periods where one group goes from 2 to 3 units of treatment, but no group has a treatment equal to 2 at both dates. To avoid loosing that observation, one can create a variable <code>D_recat</code> that takes the same value when D=1 or 2 (e.g.: <code>D_recat=(D&gt;=1)+(D&gt;=3)+(D&gt;=4)</code>), and then specify the <code>recat_treatment = "D_recat"</code> option. Then, the command can also use groups with a treatment equal to 1 at two consecutive dates as controls for groups going from 2 to 3 units of treatment, thus making it more likely that all switchers have a non-empty set of controls.</p>

For instance, assume that you estimate the instantaneous effect, effect_0, and one dynamic effect, effect_1. You would assess whether <code class="reqn">2/3</code> effect_0+ <code class="reqn">1/3</code> effect_1, a weighted average of those two effects, is statistically significant. You can specify the covariances option, use the fact that Var(<code class="reqn">2/3</code> effect_0+<code class="reqn">1/3</code> effect_1)=4/9V(effect_0)+1/9V(effect_1)+4/9cov(effect_0,effect_1) to compute the standard error of <code class="reqn">2/3</code> effect_0+<code class="reqn">1/3</code> effect_1, and finally assess if this average effect is significant. This option can also be useful to run an F-test of whether the placebos are all equal to 0, when several placebos are requested.</p>

</p>


<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>did_multiplegt_old estimates the effect of a treatment on an outcome, using group- (e.g. county- or state-) level panel data with multiple groups and periods.  Like other recently proposed DID estimation commands (did, didimputation...), did_multiplegt can be used with a binary and staggered (absorbing) treatment. But unlike those other commands, did_multiplegt_old can also be used with a non-binary treatment (discrete or continuous) that can increase or decrease multiple times. The panel of groups may be unbalanced: not all groups have to be observed at every period (see FAQ section for more info on that). The data may also be at a more disaggregated level than the group level (e.g. individual-level wage data to measure the effect of a regional-level minimum-wage on individuals' wages).
</p>
<p>It computes the <code class="reqn">DID_M</code> estimator introduced in Section 4 of Chaisemartin and D'Haultfoeuille (2019), which generalizes the standard DID estimator with two groups, two periods and a binary treatment to situations with many groups,many periods and a potentially non-binary treatment. For each pair of consecutive time periods <code class="reqn">t-1</code> and <code class="reqn">t</code> and for each value of the treatment <code class="reqn">d</code>, the package computes a <code class="reqn">DID</code> estimator comparing the outcome evolution among the switchers, the groups whose treatment changes from <code class="reqn">d</code> to some other value between <code class="reqn">t-1</code> and <code class="reqn">t</code>, to the same evolution among control groups whose treatment is equal to <code class="reqn">d</code> both in <code class="reqn">t-1</code> and <code class="reqn">t</code>. Then the <code class="reqn">DID_M</code> estimator is equal to the average of those <code class="reqn">DID</code>s across all pairs of consecutive time periods and across all values of the treatment. Under a parallel trends assumption, <code class="reqn">DID_M</code> is an unbiased and consistent estimator of the average treatment effect among switchers, at the time period when they switch.
</p>
<p>The package can also compute placebo estimators that can be used to test the parallel trends assumption.
</p>
<p>Finally, in staggered adoption designs where each group's treatment is weakly increasing over time, it can compute estimators of switchers' dynamic treatment effects, one time period or more after they have started receiving the treatment.
</p>
<p>WARNING: To estimate event-study/dynamic effects, we strongly recommend using the much faster did_multiplegt_dyn command, available from the CRAN repository. In addition to that, did_multiplegt_dyn offers more options than did_multiplegt_old.
