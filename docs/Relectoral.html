<td>Description:</td>
<td>Functions to obtain an important number of electoral indicators described in the package, which can be divided into two large sections: The first would be the one containing the indicators of electoral disproportionality, such as, Rae index, Loosemore–Hanby index, etc. The second group is intended to study the dimensions of the party system vote, through the indicators of electoral fragmentation, polarization, volatility, etc. Moreover, multiple seat allocation simulations can also be performed based on different allocation systems, such as the D'Hondt method, Sainte-Laguë, etc. Finally, some of these functions have been built so that, if the user wishes, the data provided by the Spanish Ministry of Home Office for different electoral processes held in Spain can be obtained automatically. All the above will allow the users to carry out deep studies on the results obtained in any type of electoral process. The methods are described in: Oñate, Pablo and Ocaña, Francisco A. (1999, ISBN:9788474762815); Ruiz Rodríguez, Leticia M. and Otero Felipe, Patricia (2011, ISBN:9788474766226).</td>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>With this function, the following indicators of electoral disproportionality can be
obtained for aggregated data:
</p>

<ul>
<li><p> Sainte Lagüe (SL)
</p>
</li>
<li><p> RAE (R)
</p>
</li>
<li><p> RAE Corrected (Rco)
</p>

</p>
</li>
<li><p> Tukey's line (LT)
</p>
</li></ul>

<p>All the values of these indicators are in an output data.frame where the names of the columns
coincide with the identification of these indicators which appear between brackets above.
</p>
<p>Likewise the following voting size indicators are also obtained:
</p>

<ul>
<li><p> Electoral and Parliamentary fragmentation (F)
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Effective number of political parties (N)
</p>
</li>

</li></ul>

<p>The electoral and parliamentary versions are calculated for these voting size indicators.
Their values are stored in the output of this function within a data.frame with the
name of the columns indicated with the initials shown above in parentheses and the suffix '_electoral' is added
to indicate that it is the electoral version or the suffix '_parliamentary' to indicate
that it is the parliamentary version.
</p>
<p><strong>Important note</strong>. With this function you can get the results automatically or manually.
With the automatic form, the data are downloaded from the Spanish Ministry of Home Office. With
the manual form, you have to provide the data using a data.frame with the structure that will
be indicated later.

<h2 id='Bazi'>Utilities. Generation of *.bazi files</h2><span id='topic+Bazi'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>BAZI is a freely available Java program that implements various
methods of distributing seats for proportional representation systems. It
offers the possibility of using divisor methods as well as quota methods.
The program can be downloaded from <a href="https://www.math.uni-augsburg.de/htdocs/emeriti/pukelsheim/bazi/">https://www.math.uni-augsburg.de/htdocs/emeriti/pukelsheim/bazi/</a>
Instructions on its use can be found at the following webpage:
<a href="https://opus.bibliothek.uni-augsburg.de/opus4/frontdoor/index/index/docId/601">https://opus.bibliothek.uni-augsburg.de/opus4/frontdoor/index/index/docId/601</a>.
With this function you obtain flat ASCII files, with extension '.bazi' that
structures the data in the form that can be understood by BAZI program and
obtain the results that can be accessed with this application. This function
has been designed so that it can be used both automatically or manually, that is
to say, it will work autonomously if after giving the corresponding parameters
it connects to the databases of the Spanish Ministry of the Interior, downloads
the results and generates the file with extension &quot;.bazi&quot;. The manual procedure,
is designed to be provided with the appropriate data and that this function is
responsible for transforming them to the format that BAZI understands to
generate the results for which it is programmed. Let's see below how to
proceed in each case.
</p>
<p>First of all, it should be pointed out that the &quot;camino&quot; parameter must be
provided both with the manual and the automatic procedure, and it should indicate
the path to be used to store the file with the &quot;.bazi&quot; extension that is
generated as a result of this process. It must also be taken into account
that a path with writing permission for R must be provided.
</p>
<p>The manual or automatic procedure is indicated by the &quot;Auto&quot; parameter of
the Bazi() function, so that if &quot;TRUE&quot; (default value) is valid, the automatic
procedure will be executed and otherwise the manual one.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>Bazi(
  Ano = 0,
  Mes,
  camino = "",
  cota = 3,
  Auto = TRUE,
  votes,
  seats,
  Titulo = ""
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table role = "presentation">
<tr><td><code id="Bazi_+3A_ano">Ano</code></td>
<td>
<p>. For automatic procedure only. This value indicates the year of the data
you want to download. This data can be numerical or of character type (better numeric)</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="Bazi_+3A_mes">Mes</code></td>
<td>
<p>. For automatic procedure only. This value refers to the month in which the
election was held. It must be of character type with two digits always  i.e. &quot;04&quot; is valid but &quot;4&quot; is not.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="Bazi_+3A_camino">camino</code></td>
<td>
<p>. For manual and automatic procedure. You must indicate a local
hard disk path where you download the file from the Ministry of Interior (once
the process is finished it will be deleted automatically), and then the file will
be written with the extension '.bazi' ready to be used by BAZI. Please note that
this path must indicate a disk space with write permission so that the R program
can save the results into it.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="Bazi_+3A_cota">cota</code></td>
<td>
<p>. Only for automatic procedure. It will be the electoral threshold that
the user wants to use. In the case of the Congress of Deputies in Spain it is 3 per
cent (parties with less than 3 per cent of the valid votes do not take part in the
distribution), and it is the value that has been assigned by default.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="Bazi_+3A_auto">Auto</code></td>
<td>
<p>. To choose whether to use manual and automatic procedure. If it is equal to TRUE,
the automatic procedure is executed, otherwise the manual procedure is carried out.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="Bazi_+3A_votes">votes</code></td>
<td>
<p>. Only needed for manual procedure. It must be a dataframe type

<p>The standardised party nationalisation index developed by Bochsler (2010)
can be calculated using an excel spreadsheet, which can be downloaded from the following
website: <a href="https://www.bochsler.eu/pns/">https://www.bochsler.eu/pns/</a>. This Excel file
contains a macro to calculate the match nationalisation index, which is widely used
nowadays. The aim of this function is to create an Excel sheet that
is directly loaded with the data provided by the Spanish Ministry of the Interior (MIR),
<a href="http://www.infoelectoral.mir.es/">http://www.infoelectoral.mir.es/</a>.
This data is arranged in such a way that it is only necessary to copy and paste it into
the macro created by Bochsler. This makes it much easier to load the macro function with
data. In the Excel sheet that is created, the last row contains the totals that are the
ones to be placed in row 8 of Daniel Bochsler's macro function.

<h2 id='competitividad'>Voting Dimension Index. Competitiveness (electoral and parliamentary).</h2><span id='topic+competitividad'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This index will measure the level of electoral competition that exists in a given
party system between the first and second party that have obtained more votes in an specific election.
This indicator will therefore show how much rivalry there is between the two parties that
have received the most votes. To measure this phenomenon, the proximity or remoteness of the results
of these two political formations are used. This indicator is calculated using the following formula:
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">competitiveness=1-(p_1-p_2)</code>
</p>

<p>Where p1 and p2 are the percentages of votes (or seats), as parts per unit, of the two most voted political
formations. A value close to 1 (p1=p2) indicates strong competitiveness, while a value of zero
(p1=1 p2=0) will indicate there is no competitiveness.

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This index tries to rectify the defect in the Cox_Shugart index, since the latter is
very sensitive to the presence of small political parties. To correct this deficiency,
this indicator is calculated by not taking into account parties that do not obtain
parliamentary representation. In fact, when its value is calculated the only thing
that is done is to eliminate the votes for parties that do not have obtained any seats and
those results are passed to the &quot;Cox_Shugart()&quot; function.

<h2 id='IN_LAGO_MONTERO'>Nationalisation Index of Montero and Lago (2010)</h2><span id='topic+IN_LAGO_MONTERO'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This nationalisation index, whose value ranges between 0 and 1,
was proposed by Lago and Montero (2010) and is based on the decision of the
parties to take part in the electoral process in all or only some districts. It
is calculated by taking into account the electoral results of the parties, as
well as the number of seats in the districts where they are elegible. The
formula that is used is as follows:
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">E=\sum_{j=1}^{J}p_{j}^{e}*q_{j}</code>
</p>

<p>Where:
p_j is the number of votes obtained in all the territories over the total expressed as parts per unit.
q_j is the number of seats (out of the total number of seats) in the districts where political
formation j is presented, expressed as parts per unit.
</p>
<p>Two procedures have been enabled for the calculation of this index, one will be called 'automatic' and
the other one 'manual'. With the automatic procedure it will use the data of the Spanish

<h2 id='InjusticiaM'>utilities.Mathematical Injustice ( IM )</h2><span id='topic+InjusticiaM'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This indicator was proposed by Edward V. Huntington and measures the degree
of &quot;injustice&quot; in an electoral system by translating the votes obtained by political parties
into seats. In this sense, Edward V.Huntington defined this mathematical injustice
between two parties competing in an electoral process as the difference in absolute value
between the ratios of seats and votes obtained by those two political parties. That is,
for each political party the ratio between seats and votes is obtained, and the
mathematical injustice will be the difference in absolute value of those ratios.
</p>
<p>If we express the above in a mathematical formula we get the following:
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">IM_{ij}=\left|\frac{e_{i}}{v_{i}}-\frac{e_{j}}{v_{j}}\right|</code>
</p>

<p>for <code class="reqn">i =1,  2, \ldots,n </code> and vi the votes of the party i and ei its seats

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The function of this same package called 'InjusticeM()',
allows to obtain the mathematical injustice for the dataset that is going
going to be used for the study. However, if we want to obtain the mathematical injustice for
different geographical areas, a significant effort and time is required
to prepare and execute the data. With this function, this process is
greatly expedited, if what we want to evaluate are results to the
Congress of Deputies in Spain (or its counterpart in other countries),
since thanks to this function, the information from the Ministry of
Interior can be automatically extracted and processed directly for
each province and national data, and the result is returned in a
list() type object, where each element corresponds to the result
obtained for each province or the total for the whole nation under study.
</p>
<p>Likewise, if you have another type of election, you can use the parameter
Auto=FALSE, and two data.frame will be provided with the characteristics
that will be indicated later. In this way the mathematical injustices
will be calculated for each region that is indicated in those data.frames

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The result is a list with 53 elements (for the automatic procedure), so
that each element is a matrix containing the data of the calculated mathematical
injustice. The 'names' in this list are those of Spanish provinces, or the
expression 'Total' if they are the data of all Spain.
When the procedure is not automatic, a list is also obtained containing a
number of elements equal to the number of regions provided plus one, as there
is an element called 'Total' which refers to all the territories provided as a whole.

<p>This indicator is also known as the robust bias index. Its value is obtained
by using the slope of the well-known &quot;Tuckey Line&quot; and its use is recommended when there is
a &quot;small&quot; group of parties that behave significantly differently from the rest. This
procedure is qualified as &quot;robust&quot; because the presence of behaviors of certain parties
different from the rest does not substantially alter the line obtained, unlike what happened
when it was used in the least squares criteria to make the regression adjustment.#'

<h2 id='polarizacion'>Dimensionality of voting. Polarization index. ( PP )</h2><span id='topic+polarizacion'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This dimension is one of the most important in democratic systems, as it explains part
of the stability and bankruptcy problems of democracies. The index that is calculated with this
function needs the data of the ideological location of the parties, which are difficult to obtain, and
that is something as simple as a scale of values between 1 and 10, in such a way that the closer to 1 the
valuation of a political party is, it will be more classified as left-wing ideology, and the opposite case will
occur when a political formation has a rating at the other end of the scale. The value obtained for this
ideological position will be placed in the second column of the data.frame called  &quot;data&quot;, which is
the first parameter that is passed to the function and whose structure is explained later, in the
parameters section. If the indicator takes a value close to zero, it means there will be
no polarization, and the polarization will increase as the indicator takes higher values.
</p>
<p>In this section the weighted polarization index is calculated. For its calculation the following
formulas will be used:
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">Pp=\sum_{i=1}^{n}p_{i}(x_{i}-\overline{x}_{p})^{2}</code>
</p>

<p>for <code class="reqn">i = 1, 2, \ldots,n</code>

<h2 id='polarizacion_Dalton'>Dimensionality of voting. Adapted version of the polarisation index from Dalton (2008) (Pd)</h2><span id='topic+polarizacion_Dalton'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>With this function the slightly adapted version of the polarisation index from Dalton (2008)
is computed to measure polarization. This index weights the ideological positions of the parties by their
election results. This indicator ranges from 0 (in the hypothetical case that all parties occupy the same
ideological position) to 10 if the parties are at the extremes of the scale position. The formula to
compute it is as follows:
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">Pd=\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}p_{i}\left[\frac{\overline{x}_{i}-\overline{x}_{p}}{4.5}\right]^{2}}</code>
</p>

<p>Pd = sqrt(sum(p_j*(x_j-mean(x_p))/4.5)^2)

<h2 id='Rae'>Disproportionality index of Rae - 1971 (&quot;R&quot;)</h2><span id='topic+Rae'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This index measures electoral disproportionality based on the result obtained in an election.
It has the disadvantage that it is highly influenced by the number of small parties that compete in
the elections. The formula used is as follows:
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">R=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}|E_{i}-V_{i}|}{n}</code>
</p>

<p>for <code class="reqn">i = 1, 2, \ldots,n</code>
</p>
<p>To compute its value, an integer vector corresponding to the votes obtained by each party and another with
the corresponding seats must be provided as parameters of the formula. The R code will be in charge of
calculating the corresponding percentages to obtain the index.

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>It was Rae himself who realised the problems in calculating the RAE index by taking
all parties into account. For this reason he reviewed the basis of the index and decided to exclude
from the calculation all parties that did not reach 0.5 percent of the votes. The function created
to calculate this index takes this corrective value by default, although it is allowed to enter another value,
as it can be seen in the example below.
</p>
<p>To compute its value, the integer vectors corresponding to the votes obtained by each party and
their seats must be provided as parameters of the formula. The R code will be in charge of
calculating the corresponding percentages in order to obtain the index.

will work internally. In this case, the csv file generated will contain a column with the acronyms of
the political parties, and then, manually, &quot;1&quot; will be written down if the match is &quot;PANE&quot; (nationalist or regionalist party) and 0 if it
is &quot;NO PANE&quot; (non-nationalist or non-regionalist party). That is to say, with the parameter Generate_PANES = TRUE, a help system is obtained to
obtain the file that must be passed with the &quot;PANES&quot; parameter. But this csv file can also be generated
in a completely manual way, if the user wishes.</p>

<h2 id='reparto_div'>Allocation using divisor methods</h2><span id='topic+reparto_div'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This option uses various methods whose main common feature is that the number of
votes obtained by the political candidatures are divided by a series of numbers. The name of the
method used depends on the numbers which compose that series. In this sense, the methods
admitted are the following:
</p>

<ol>
<li> <p><b>dhont</b>. It is the so-called D'Hondt Law and is the procedure used in Spain
to transform votes into seats in the Congress of Deputies. The series of numbers used
as a quotient are the integer numbers: 1,2,...n , where n is the number of seats to be distributed.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><b>saint_lague</b>. This is the Sainte Lagüe method, Webster's method or odd-numbered divisors.
The set of divisors is formed by the odd numbers, that is 1,3,..,2n+1.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><b>saint_lague_Mod</b>.It is the modified Sainte Lagüe method, a variant of the Sainte Lagüe
method, according to which the initial quotient is v/1.4 and once each party has a seat the
standard formula v/(2n+1) is used.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><b>Danish</b>. In this method the divisors go from three to three units, that is to say
it is formed by the numbers: 1,4,7,10,13... and the n-th divisor would be 3*n-2.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><b>Imperiali</b>. The divisors are the positive integers but starting from number 2
onwards, that is: 2,3,4,...
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><b>Hill_Huntington</b>. In this case the divisors are formed by the following sequence:
sqrt(2),sqrt(6),sqrt(12),...., sqrt(n*(n+1))
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><b>Dean</b>.The set of divisors consists of the following numbers:
4/3, 12/5, 24/7,40/0,....,(2<em>n)(n+1)/(2</em>n+1)
</p>
</li></ol>

<p>In all cases the value of q is rounded up to the nearest integer.

<h2 id='Restos_Mayores'>Largest remainder method</h2><span id='topic+Restos_Mayores'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function is used to translate votes into seats,
following the criterion called &quot;Largest Remains&quot;. In summary, this method is
calculated as follows: the total number of votes is divided by the total number of seats
(cost of each seat). The votes of each party are then divided by the above
ratio. The integer part of the above results are taken, which will be the
initial seats for each party. The remaining seats to be distributed are
allocated to the parties with the largest remainders (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Largest_remainder_method ).
</p>
<p>The cost of each seat is what differentiates one method from another. Thus
if n is the total number of seats and m the sum of all votes, the denomination
of the methods is as follows, depending on the ratio that is taken:
</p>

<ol>
<li> <p><b>Hare (Hare)</b>: q=m/n
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><b>Droop (Droop)</b>:q=1+(m/(1+n))
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><b>Imperiali (Imperiali)</b>: q=m/(n+2)
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><b>Imperiali modificado (Mod_Imperiali)</b>: q=m/(n+3)
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><b>Hangenbach Bischof (hangenbach-bischo)</b>: q=m/(n+1)
</p>
</li></ol>

<p>In all cases the value of q is rounded to the nearest integer.

number of the row(s) of the party(ies) of the first electoral period to be grouped. The
next 10 columns (called p2_i for i=1,2,...,10) are used to indicate the number of the
row(s) of the party(ies) of the second electoral period to be grouped. When some of the
10 columns are not needed, the remaining columns are filled in with zeros. The data in each
row is used with following purpose: For the first block of 10 columns, the votes/seats of the
parties appearing in that block are added up. For the second block of 10 columns, the
votes/seats in that second block are also added up. These two values will be used later on
for comparison. The last column of this data.frame (called &quot;block&quot;), will contain the values
&quot;D&quot; or &quot;I&quot; indicating &quot;Right&quot;, &quot;Left&quot;, respectively.
