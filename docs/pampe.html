Example Data for pampe function from the pampe package
</h2><span id='topic+growth'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Dataset for the example from the pampe function of the pampe package. The growth dataset, obtained from the supplemental materials of Hsiao, Steve Ching and Ki Wan (2012) contains information on the quarterly real GDP growth rate of 24 countries (the donor pool) and Hong Kong from 1993 Q1 to 2008 Q1, computed as the change with respect to the same quarter in the previous year. The data is organized in standard cross-sectional data format, with the variables (the quarterly real GDP growth rate of the countries in the donor pool act as explanatory variables) extending across the columns and the quarters (time-periods) extending across rows. In this case the treated unit, Hong Kong, is in the first column whereas the possible controls (countries in the original donor pool) are in columns 2:25. It is important for the user to have his or her data in this standard format to correctly apply the methodology. Naming the rows and especially the columns is also strongly recommended. Be careful to avoid characters such as spacing when naming.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>data(growth)</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 61 observations on 25 variables (countries/units).

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Implements the Panel Data Approach for program evaluation as developed in Hsiao, Steve Ching and Ki Wan (2012). pampe estimates the effect of an intervention by comparing the evolution of the outcome for a unit affected by an intervention or treatment to the evolution of the unit had it not been affected by the intervention.</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>pampe(time.pretr, time.tr, treated, controls = "All", data,
nbest = 1, nvmax = length(controls), select = "AICc", placebos = FALSE)
data(growth)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr><td><code id="pampe_+3A_time.pretr">time.pretr</code></td>
<td>

<p>The pre-treatment periods, up to the introduction of the treatment. For example, if you have 10 pre-treatment periods and the treatment was introduced in the 11th period, this argument could be 1:10.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="pampe_+3A_time.tr">time.tr</code></td>
<td>

<p>The treatment period plus the periods for which you want to check the effect. For example, if the treatment was introduced in the 11th period and you want results for 9 more periods, it would be 11:20.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="pampe_+3A_treated">treated</code></td>
<td>

<p>The treated unit, the unit that receives the intervention. It can be a name or the index of the column if the columns in the data matrix are named (recommended). For example, in the case of the growth data included in the package, the name of the treated unit is &quot;HongKong&quot;, and it is in the first column of the data matrix, so this argument can be either &quot;HongKong&quot; or 1.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="pampe_+3A_controls">controls</code></td>
<td>

<p>The units used as controls to calculate the counterfactual, that have not received the treatment. By default, all the remaining (after removing the treated) columns in the data matrix are included as columns, but specific controls can be specified using their column name, e.g. c(&quot;Australia&quot;, &quot;Austria&quot;, &quot;Canada&quot;) or their column index, e.g. 2:4.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="pampe_+3A_data">data</code></td>
<td>

<p>The name of the data matrix to be used, e.g. growth. The data matrix should be in standard cross-sectional format: with the variables (the controls/units in the donor pool pool act as explanatory variables) extending across the columns and the quarters (time-periods) extending across rows. It is important for the user to have his or her data in this standard format to correctly apply the function. Naming the rows and especially the columns is also strongly recommended. Be careful to avoid characters such as spacing when naming.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="pampe_+3A_nbest">nbest</code></td>
<td>

<p>The original method by Hsiao, Steve Ching and Ki Wan (2012) specifies to keep the best model in terms of R squared for each order, hence the default is one. However the user might choose to keep the best 2, 3... before moving on to the second step of the method by switching this argument default.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="pampe_+3A_nvmax">nvmax</code></td>
<td>

<p>How many subsets of controls should the method check. The original method by Hsiao says to check all subsets up to the biggest size, hence the default; but if the pre-treatment period is too short that might not be possible. If it's too big but attempt to apply the method regardless, it will throw out an error telling you to change this argument or reduce the number of controls.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="pampe_+3A_select">select</code></td>
<td>

<p>The model selection criteria for the second step of the method. Originally they propose either AICc (default) or AIC. The user can choose between those two or BIC as well.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="pampe_+3A_placebos">placebos</code></td>
<td>

<p>Options between &quot;controls&quot;, &quot;time&quot;, or &quot;Both&quot;. The &quot;controls&quot; placebo method reassigns the treatment to all controls and computes the treatment effect, the &quot;time&quot; placebo reassigns treatment to a time period previous to the treatment and computes the treatment effect as well. You can then plot the results.
</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>As proposed by Hsiao, Steve Ching and Ki Wan (2012), the panel data approach method for program evaluation estimates the effect of a treatment or policy intervention in the aggregate outcome of a single affected unit by exploiting the dependence among cross-sectional units to construct a counterfactual of the treated unit(s), which is an estimate of how the affected unit would have developed in the absence of an intervention. The estimated effect of the policy intervention is therefore simply the difference between the actual observed outcome of the treated unit and this estimated counterfactual.
</p>
<p>The way they propose to estimate the outcome of the treated unit under no treatment, Y^0_1t, is to use the following modeling strategy: use R^2 (or likelihood values) in order to select the best OLS estimator for Y^0_1t using j out of the J units in the donor pool, denoted by M(j)* for j=1, ..., J; then choose M(m)* from M(1)*, ..., M(J)* in terms of a model selection criterion, like AICc, AIC or BIC. Note that the method calculates OLS models of up to J+1 parameters; so that if the length of the pre-treatment period t=1, 2, ..., T'-1 is not of a much higher order than that, the regressions M(J-1)*, M(J)* can not be calculated because there are not enough degrees of freedom.
</p>
<p>To avoid this problem, the pampe package proposes the following slight modification to the previously outlined modeling strategy: use R^2 in order to select the best OLS estimator for Y^0_1t using j out of the J units in the donor pool, denoted by M(j)* for j=1, ..., T_0-4; then choose M(m)* from M(1)*, ..., M(T_0-4)* in terms of a model selection criterion (in our case AICc). Note that the key difference is that while we allowed models up to M(J)*, this is now modified to allow models up to M(T_0-4)*, with T_0-4&lt;J, which allows for at least 3 degrees of freedom. This is implemented through the default value of nvmax, which is equal to J, or if not possible, to J-4. The user can of course override this default.
</p>
<p>The results of the function include, among others, the optimal model chosen by the strategy (an object of class lm) and the estimated treatment effects (difference between the actual outcome and the counterfactual outcome) for the placebo tests if the user chooses to carry them out.
</p>

</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>counterfactual</code></td>
<td>

</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>placebo.ctrl</code></td>

<p> if the user has chosen to perform the placebo test which reassigns the treatment to the controls in the original donor pool, this element is a list which includes another two elements: mspe and tr.effect. The first includes the mspe for the pre-treatment period (time.pretr) and the second is the estimated treatment effect for the treated unit in the first column and for the countries in the original donor pool in the remaining columns. </p>
