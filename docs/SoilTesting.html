<td>Description:</td>
<td>Testing of soil for the contents of organic carbon, and available macro- and micro-nutrients is a crucial part of soil fertility assessment. This package computes some routinely tested soil properties viz. organic carbon (C), total nitrogen (N), available N, mineral N, available phosphorus (P), available potassium (K), available iron (Fe), available zinc (Zn), available manganese (Mn), available copper (Cu), and available nickel (Ni) in soil based on laboratory analysis data obtained by most commonly followed protocols. Besides, it can also draw standard curves based on absorption/emission vs. concentration data, and give out unknown concentrations from absorption/emission readings.</td>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Available K is commonly extracted by 1 N ammonium acetate (pH 7), and determined by a flame photometer directly, or after dilution if needed (Hanway and Heidel, 1952). It includes solution K and exchangeable K present in soil, and is readily available to plants (Das et al., 2022). In case of no additional dilution after extraction, the values of VA and VF should be put as 1.

After extraction, blue colour is developed using ascorbic acid method, the intensity of which is measured using a spectrophotometer (Watanabe and Olsen, 1965).

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Mineral N in soil consists of ammonium and nitrate ions present on soil exchange sites or solution or both. It can be extracted by 2 M KCl. The extract is steam-distilled in the presence of magnesium oxide and Devarda’s alloy (Cu: Al: Zn :: 50: 45: 5) to liberate ammonia. The evolved ammonia is absorbed in 2% boric acid solution containing mixed indicator, pH 4.5, and titrated against standard sulphuric acid solution to know the volume of the boric acid consumed during ammonia absorption (Rowell, 1994; Biswas, 2018).

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>In a soil, total N can be determined by first digesting the soil with concentrated sulphuric acid in presence of a digestion mixture containing potassium sulphate, cupric sulphate, and selenium powder in the ratio 200: 20: 1 at 390±5 °C till a clear solution (greenish coloured) is obtained. Then the acid digest is distilled with alkali (generally 40% NaOH) to liberate ammonia gas which is then absorbed in 4% boric acid solution, pH 4.5, and titrated against standard sulphuric acid solution to know the volume of the boric acid consumed during ammonia absorption (Bremner, 1996; Biswas, 2018). For available or mineralizable N, soil is distilled with alkaline potassium permanganate solution (0.32%). The potassium permanganate oxidizes a part of soil organic matter, and liberates ammonia gas in the presence of an alkali, e.g., 40% NaOH. The evolved ammonia is absorbed in 2% boric acid solution containing mixed indicator, pH 4.5, and titrated against standard sulphuric acid solution to know the volume of the boric acid consumed during ammonia absorption (Subbiah and Asija, 1956; Biswas, 2018).

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>For elements like phosphorus (P), sulphur (S), boron (B), the determination of concentration in the extract is done by a spectrophotometer based on absorbance readings corresponding to different known concentrations. For elements like potassium (K), sodium (Na), the determination of concentration in the extract is done by a flame photometer based on emission readings corresponding to different known concentrations. In each case, a standard curve is fitted between the absorbance or emission readings and the concentrations of the particular element in the working standard solutions. A linear regression equation can be fitted to the curve, based on which the concentration of the element under consideration in the sample extract can be determined.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Soil organic C is very important to soil fertility, nutrient cycling and C sequestration. Routine soil testing includes determination of oxidizable organic C as per the method described by Walkley and Black (1934). The oxidizable organic C mostly encompasses C present in partly decomposed organic matter and slightly the well decomposed organic matter in soil (Basak, 2000). The method suggested by Walkley and Black (1934) involves oxidation of soil organic C with an excess of standard (usually 1 N) potassium dichromate solution (usually, 10 mL for 1 g soil) in presence of concentrated sulphuric acid (20 mL). The unreacted potassium dichromate solution is titrated against freshly prepared ferrous ammonium sulphate solution to get the volume of potassium dichromate solution consumed in oxidizing soil organic C, from which the content of oxidizable organic C is calculated.

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>WBC_pc - Oxidizable organic C or Walkley-Black C in soil (%)
WBC_gkg - Oxidizable organic C or Walkley-Black C in soil (g/kg)
