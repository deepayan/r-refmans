<h3>Details</h3>

<p>ACI can be calculated using disaggregated data and individual-level data.
Subgroups in disaggregated data are weighted according to their population
share, while individuals are weighted by sample weight in the case of data
from surveys.
</p>
<p>The calculation of ACI is based on a ranking of the whole population from
the most-disadvantaged subgroup (at rank 0) to the most-advantaged subgroup
(at rank 1), which is inferred from the ranking and size of the subgroups.
For more information on this inequality measure see Schlotheuber, A., &amp;
Hosseinpoor, A. R. (2022) below.
</p>
<p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> The larger the absolute value of ACI, the higher the
level of inequality. For favourable indicators, positive values indicate
a concentration of the indicator among the advantaged, while negative
values indicate a concentration of the indicator among the disadvantaged.
For adverse indicators, it is the reverse: positive values indicate a
concentration of the indicator among the disadvantaged, while negative
values indicate a concentration of the indicator among the advantaged.
ACI is zero if there is no inequality.
</p>
<p><strong>Type of summary measure:</strong> Complex; absolute; weighted
</p>
<p><strong>Applicability:</strong> Ordered; more than two subgroups
</p>
<p><strong>Warning:</strong> The confidence intervals are approximate
and might be biased.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The estimated ACI value, corresponding estimated standard error,
and confidence interval as a <code>data.frame</code>.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>BGSD is calculated as the square root of the weighted average of squared
differences between the subgroup estimates and the setting average.
Squared differences are weighted by each subgroup‚Äôs population share.
For more information on this inequality measure see Schlotheuber,
A., &amp; Hosseinpoor, A. R. (2022) below.
</p>
<p>95% confidence intervals are calculated using a methodology of simulated
estimates. The dataset is simulated a large number of times (e.g., 100)
and BGSD is calculated for each of the simulated samples. The 95%
confidence intervals are based on the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of the
BGSD results.
</p>
<p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> BGSD has only positive values, with larger values
indicating higher levels of inequality. BGSD is zero if there is no
inequality. It has the same unit as the health indicator.
</p>
<p><strong>Type of summary measure:</strong> Complex; absolute; weighted
</p>
<p><strong>Applicability:</strong> Non-ordered; more than two subgroups

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>COV is calculated by dividing the between-group standard
deviation (BGSD) by the setting average and multiplying the fraction
by 100. BGSD is calculated as the square root of the weighted average
of squared differences between the subgroup estimates and the
setting average. Squared differences are weighted by each subgroup‚Äôs
population share. For more information on this inequality measure see
Schlotheuber, A., &amp; Hosseinpoor, A. R. (2022) below.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>D is calculated as: <code>D = y_1 - y_2</code>, where <code>y_1</code> and <code>y_2</code> indicate the
estimates for subgroups 1 and 2. The selection of the two subgroups depends
on the characteristics of the inequality dimension and the purpose of the
analysis. In addition, the direction of the calculation may depend on the
indicator type (favourable or#'  adverse).
</p>
<p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> Greater absolute values indicate higher levels of
inequality. D is zero if there is no inequality.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>IDISU is calculated as the average of absolute differences between the
subgroup estimates and the setting average, divided by the number of
subgroups and the setting average, and multiplied by 100. For more
information on this inequality measure see Schlotheuber, A., &amp;

confidence intervals are based on the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of the
IDISU results.
</p>
<p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> IDISU has only positive values, with larger values
indicating higher levels of inequality. IDISU is zero if there is no

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This dataset contains sample data for computing non-ordered summary measures
of health inequality. It contains data from a household survey for two
indicators, births attended by skilled health personnel (sba) and Diphtheria
tetanus toxoid and pertussis (DTP3) immunization coverage, disaggregated by
economic status. Both indicators are binary, (1) for those who had sba or dpt3
or (0) if the had not.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Births attended by skilled health personnel is defined as a birth attended
by skilled health personnel divided by the total number of live births to
women aged 15-49 years occurring in the period prior to the survey.
Skilled health personnel include doctors, nurses, midwives and other
medically trained personnel, as defined according to each country. DPT3 is
measured among one-year-olds and indicate those who have received three doses
of the combined diphtheria, tetanus toxoid and pertussis containing vaccine
in a given year.This is in line with the definition used by the Countdown to
2030 Collaboration, Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), Multiple Indicator
Cluster Surveys (MICS) and Reproductive Health Surveys (RHS).
</p>
<p>Economic status is determined using a wealth index, which is based on owning
selected assets and having access to certain services. The wealth index is
divided into five equal subgroups (quintiles) that each account for 20% of
the population. Economic status is an ordered dimension (meaning that the
subgroups have an inherent ordering).
</p>
<p>This dataset can be used to calculate ordered summary measures of health
inequality, including: absolute concentration index (ACI), relative
concentration index (RCI), slope index of inequality (SII) and relative
index of inequality (RII).

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The unweighted version (MDRU) is calculated as the average of absolute
differences between the subgroup estimates and the estimate for the

on this inequality measure see Schlotheuber, A., &amp; Hosseinpoor, A. R. (2022)
below.
</p>
<p>95% confidence intervals are calculated using a methodology of simulated
estimates. The dataset is simulated a large number of times (e.g., 100)

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>PAF is calculated as the difference between the estimate for the
reference subgroup and the setting average, divided by the setting
average and multiplied by 100. For more information on this inequality
measure see Schlotheuber, A., &amp; Hosseinpoor, A. R. (2022) below.
</p>
<p>If the indicator is favourable and PAF &lt; 0, then PAF is replaced with 0.
If the indicator is adverse and PAF &gt; 0, then PAF is replaced with 0.
The selection of the reference subgroup depends on the characteristics
of the inequality dimension and the indicator type. It is the
most-advantaged subgroup for ordered dimensions. For non-ordered
dimensions, it is the subgroup with the highest estimate for favourable
indicators and is the subgroup with the lowest estimate for adverse
indicators.
</p>
<p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> PAF assumes positive values for favourable
indicators and negative values for non-favourable (adverse) indicators.
The larger the absolute value of PAF, the higher the level of
inequality. PAF is zero if no further improvement can be achieved
(i.e., if all subgroups have reached the same level of the
indicator as the reference subgroup or surpassed that level).
</p>
<p><strong>Type of summary measure:</strong> Complex; relative; weighted
</p>
<p><strong>Applicability:</strong> Any
</p>
<p><strong>Warning:</strong> The confidence intervals are approximate
and might be biased. See Walter S.D. (1978) below for
further information on the standard error formula.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>PAR is calculated as the difference between the estimate for the
reference subgroup and the setting average. For more information
on this inequality measure see Schlotheuber, A., &amp; Hosseinpoor, A. R.
(2022) below.
</p>
<p>If the indicator is favourable and PAR &lt; 0, then PAR is replaced with 0.
If the indicator is adverse and PAR &gt; 0, then PAR is replaced with 0.
The selection of the reference subgroup depends on the characteristics
of the inequality dimension and the indicator type. It is the
most-advantaged subgroup for ordered dimensions. For non-ordered
dimensions, it is the subgroup with the highest estimate for favourable
indicators and is the subgroup with the lowest estimate for adverse
indicators.
</p>
<p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> PAR assumes positive values for favourable
indicators and negative values for non-favourable (adverse) indicators.
The larger the absolute value of PAR, the higher the level of inequality.
PAR is zero if no further improvement can be achieved (i.e., if all
subgroups have reached the same level of the indicator as the reference
subgroup or surpassed that level).

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>R is calculated as: <code>R = y_1/y_2</code> where <code>y_1</code> and <code>y_2</code> indicate the
estimates for subgroups 1 and 2. The selection of the two subgroups depends
on the characteristics of the inequality dimension and the purpose of the
analysis. In addition, the direction of the calculation may depend on the
indicator type (favourable or adverse). Below are some examples of how
y_1 and y_2 may be identified.
</p>
<p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> The index R only assumes positive values. The further
the value of R from one, the higher the level of inequality. R is one if
there is no inequality.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>RCI is calculated by dividing the absolute concentration index (ACI)
by the setting average. RCI may be more easily interpreted
when multiplied by 100. The calculation of ACI is based on a
ranking of the whole population from the most-disadvantaged
subgroup (at rank 0) to the most-advantaged subgroup (at rank 1),
which is inferred from the ranking and size of the subgroups.
For more information on this inequality measure see
Schlotheuber, A., &amp; Hosseinpoor, A. R. (2022) below.
</p>
<p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> RCI is bounded between -1 and +1 (or between -100
and +100, when multiplied by 100). The larger the absolute value of RCI,
the higher the level of inequality. For favourable indicators, positive
values indicate a concentration of the indicator among the advantaged,
while negative values indicate a concentration of the indicator among
the disadvantaged. For adverse indicators, it is the reverse: positive
values indicate a concentration of the indicator among the disadvantaged,
while negative values indicate a concentration of the indicator among the
advantaged. RCI is zero if there is no inequality.
</p>
<p><strong>Type of summary measure:</strong> Complex; relative; weighted
</p>
<p><strong>Applicability:</strong> Ordered; more than two subgroups

<p><strong>Warning:</strong> The confidence intervals are approximate
and might be biased.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>To calculate RII, a weighted sample of the whole population is ranked from
the most-disadvantaged subgroup (at rank 0) to the most-advantaged subgroup
(at rank 1). This ranking is weighted, accounting for the proportional
distribution of the population within each subgroup. The population of
each subgroup is then considered in terms of its range in the cumulative
population distribution, and the midpoint of this range. The indicator of
interest is then regressed against this midpoint value using an appropriate
regression model (e.g., a generalized linear model with logit link), and
the predicted values of the indicator are calculated for the two extremes
(rank 1 and rank 0). The ratio between the estimated values at rank 1
and rank 0 (covering the entire distribution) generates the RII value.
For more information on this inequality measure see Schlotheuber, A., &amp;
Hosseinpoor, A. R. (2022) below.
</p>
<p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> RII has the value of one if there is no inequality. RII
has only positive values. Greater absolute values indicate higher levels of
inequality. The further the value of RII from one, the higher the level of
inequality. For favourable indicators, values larger than one indicate a
concentration of the indicator among the advantaged and values smaller than
one indicate a concentration of the indicator among the disadvantaged. For
adverse indicators, values larger than one indicate a concentration of the
indicator among the disadvantaged and values smaller than one indicate a
concentration of the indicator among the advantaged. RII is a multiplicative
measure and has to be displayed on a logarithmic scale (values larger than
one are equivalent in magnitude to their reciprocal values smaller than one,
e.g., a value of 2 is equivalent in magnitude to a value of 0.5).
</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>To calculate SII, a weighted sample of the whole population is ranked from
the most-disadvantaged subgroup (at rank 0) to the most-advantaged subgroup
(at rank 1). This ranking is weighted, accounting for the proportional
distribution of the population within each subgroup. The indicator of
interest is then regressed against this relative rank using an appropriate
regression model (e.g., a generalized linear model with logit link), and the
predicted values of the indicator are calculated for the two extremes (rank
1 and rank 0). The difference between the predicted values at rank 1 and
rank 0 (covering the entire distribution) generates the SII value. For more
information on this inequality measure see Schlotheuber, A., &amp; Hosseinpoor,
A. R. (2022) below.
</p>
<p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> SII is zero if there is no inequality. Greater absolute
values indicate higher levels of inequality. For favourable indicators,
positive values indicate a concentration of the indicator among the
