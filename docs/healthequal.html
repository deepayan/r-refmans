<h3>Details</h3>

<p>ACI can be calculated using disaggregated data and individual-level data.
Subgroups in disaggregated data are weighted according to their population
share, while individuals are weighted by sample weight in the case of data
from surveys.
</p>
<p>The calculation of ACI is based on a ranking of the whole population from
the most disadvantaged subgroup (at rank 0) to the most advantaged subgroup
(at rank 1), which is inferred from the ranking and size of the subgroups.
ACI can be calculated as twice the covariance between the health indicator
and the relative rank. Given the relationship between covariance and
ordinary least squares regression, ACI can be obtained from a
regression of a transformation of the health variable of interest on the
relative rank. For more information on this inequality measure see
Schlotheuber (2022) below.
</p>
<p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> ACI is 0 if there is no inequality. The larger the
absolute value of ACI, the higher the level of inequality. Positive values
indicate a concentration of the indicator among advantaged subgroups, and
negative values indicate a concentration of the indicator among
disadvantaged subgroups.
</p>
<p><strong>Type of summary measure:</strong> Complex; absolute; weighted
</p>
<p><strong>Applicability:</strong> Ordered dimension of inequality with more than two
subgroups
</p>
<p><strong>Warning:</strong> The confidence intervals are approximate and might be biased.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The estimated ACI value, corresponding estimated standard error,
and confidence interval as a <code>data.frame</code>.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>BGSD is calculated as the square root of the weighted average of squared
differences between the subgroup estimates and the setting average.
Squared differences are weighted by each subgroup‚Äôs population share.
For more information on this inequality measure see Schlotheuber (2022)
below.
</p>
<p>95% confidence intervals are calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation-based
method. The dataset is simulated a large number of times (e.g. 100), with
the mean and standard error of each simulated dataset being the same as the
original dataset. BGSD is calculated for each of the simulated sample
datasets. The 95% confidence intervals are based on the 2.5th and 97.5th
percentiles of the BGSD results. See Ahn (2019) below for further
information.
</p>
<p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> BGSD has only positive values, with larger values
indicating higher levels of inequality. BGSD is 0 if there is no
inequality. BGSD has the same unit as the health indicator.
</p>
<p><strong>Type of summary measure:</strong> Complex; absolute; weighted
</p>
<p><strong>Applicability:</strong> Non-ordered dimensions of inequality with more than two
subgroups

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>D is calculated as <code>D = y1 - y2</code>, where <code>y1</code> and <code>y2</code> indicate the
estimates for subgroups 1 and 2. The selection of the two subgroups depends
on the characteristics of the inequality dimension and the purpose of the

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Births attended by skilled health personnel is defined as a birth attended
by skilled health personnel divided by the total number of live births to
women aged 15-49 years occurring in the period prior to the survey.
Skilled health personnel include doctors, nurses, midwives and other
medically trained personnel, as defined according to each country. DPT3 is
measured among one-year-olds and indicate those who have received three doses
of the combined diphtheria, tetanus toxoid and pertussis containing vaccine
in a given year.This is in line with the definition used by the Countdown to
2030 Collaboration, Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), Multiple Indicator
Cluster Surveys (MICS) and Reproductive Health Surveys (RHS).
</p>
<p>Economic status is determined using a wealth index, which is based on owning
selected assets and having access to certain services. The wealth index is
divided into five equal subgroups (quintiles) that each account for 20% of
the population. Economic status is an ordered dimension (meaning that the
subgroups have an inherent ordering).
</p>
<p>This dataset can be used to calculate ordered summary measures of health
inequality, including: absolute concentration index (ACI), relative
concentration index (RCI), slope index of inequality (SII) and relative
index of inequality (RII).

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The weighted version (MDMW) is calculated as the weighted average of
absolute differences between the subgroup estimates and the mean.
Absolute differences are weighted by each subgroup's population share. For
more information on this inequality measure see Schlotheuber (2022) below.
</p>
<p>95% confidence intervals are calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation-based
method. The dataset is simulated a large number of times (e.g. 100), with
the mean and standard error of each simulated dataset being the same as the
original dataset. MDMW is calculated for each of the simulated sample
datasets. The 95% confidence intervals are based on the 2.5th and 97.5th
percentiles of the MDMW results. See Ahn (2019) below for further
information.
</p>
<p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> MDMW only has positive values, with larger values
indicating higher levels of inequality. MDMW is 0 if there is no
inequality. MDMW has the same unit as the indicator.
</p>
<p><strong>Type of summary measure:</strong> Complex; absolute; weighted
</p>
<p><strong>Applicability:</strong> Non-ordered dimensions of inequality with more than two
subgroups

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>MLD measures the extent to which the shares of the population and shares of
the health indicator differ across subgroups, weighted by shares of the
population. MLD is calculated as the sum of products between the negative
natural logarithm of the share of the indicator of each subgroup and the
population share of each subgroup. MLD may be more easily readable when
multiplied by 1000. For more information on this inequality measure see
Schlotheuber (2022) below.
</p>
<p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> MLD is 0 if there is no inequality. Greater absolute
values indicate higher levels of inequality. MLD is more sensitive to
differences further from the setting average (by the use of the logarithm).
MLD has no unit.
</p>
<p><strong>Type of summary measure:</strong> Complex; relative; weighted
</p>
<p><strong>Applicability:</strong> Non-ordered dimensions of inequality with more than two
subgroups
</p>
<p><strong>Warning:</strong> The confidence intervals are approximate and might be biased.
See Ahn (2018) below for further information on the standard error formula.

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This dataset contains sample data for computing ordered summary measures of
health inequality. It contains data from a household survey for two
indicators, the proportion of births attended by skilled health personnel
and under-five mortality rate, disaggregated by economic status.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The proportion of births attended by skilled health personnel is calculated
as the number of births attended by skilled health personnel divided by the
total number of live births to women aged 15-49 years occurring in the
period prior to the survey.
</p>
<p>Skilled health personnel include doctors, nurses, midwives and other
medically trained personnel, as defined according to each country. This is
in line with the definition used by the Countdown to 2030 Collaboration,
Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys
(MICS) and Reproductive Health Surveys (RHS).
</p>
<p>The under-five mortality rate is the probability (expressed as a rate per
1000 live births) of a child born in a specific year or period dying before
reaching the age of five years. It is calculated as the number of deaths at
age 0-5 years divided by the number of surviving children at the beginning
of the specified age range during the 10 years prior to the survey.
</p>
<p>Economic status is determined using a wealth index, which is based on owning
selected assets and having access to certain services. The wealth index is
divided into five equal subgroups (quintiles) that each account for 20% of
the population. Economic status is an ordered dimension (meaning that the
subgroups have an inherent ordering).
</p>
<p>This dataset can be used to calculate ordered summary measures of health
inequality, including: absolute concentration index (ACI), relative
concentration index (RCI), slope index of inequality (SII) and relative
index of inequality (RII). It can also be used to calculate the impact
measures population attributable risk (PAR) and population attributable
fraction (PAF).

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Population attributable fraction (PAR) is a relative measure of inequality
that shows the potential improvement in the average of an indicator, in
absolute terms, that could be achieved if all population subgroups had
the same level of the indicator as a reference point. The reference point
refers to the most advantaged subgroup for ordered dimensions and the
best-performing subgroup for non-ordered dimensions (i.e. the subgroup with
the highest value for favourable indicators and the subgroup with the lowest
value for adverse indicators).

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>PAF is calculated as the difference between the estimate for the
reference subgroup and the mean (e.g. the national average), divided by the
mean and multiplied by 100. For more information on this inequality
measure see Schlotheuber (2022) below.
</p>
<p>If the indicator is favourable and PAF &lt; 0, then PAF is replaced with 0.
If the indicator is adverse and PAF &gt; 0, then PAF is replaced with 0.
</p>
<p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> PAF assumes positive values for favourable indicators
and negative values for non-favourable (adverse) indicators. The larger the
absolute value of PAF, the higher the level of inequality. PAF is 0 if no
further improvement can be achieved (i.e., if all subgroups have reached
the same level of the indicator as the reference subgroup or surpassed that
level).
</p>
<p><strong>Type of summary measure:</strong> Complex; relative; weighted
</p>
<p><strong>Applicability:</strong> Any dimension of inequality with more than two subgroups
</p>
<p><strong>Warning:</strong> The confidence intervals are approximate and might be biased.
See Walter S.D. (1978) below for further information on the standard error
formula.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>R is calculated as <code>R = y1 / y2</code> where <code>y1</code> and <code>y2</code> indicate the
estimates for subgroups 1 and 2. The selection of the two subgroups depends
on the characteristics of the inequality dimension and the purpose of the
analysis. In addition, the direction of the calculation may depend on the
indicator type (favourable or adverse). Please see specifications of how
<code>y1</code> and <code>y2</code> are identified below.
</p>
<p>Ordered dimension:
Favourable indicator: Most-advantaged subgroup / Least-advantaged subgroup
Adverse indicator: Least-advantaged subgroup / Most-advantaged subgroup
</p>
<p>Non-ordered dimension:
No reference group &amp; favourable indicator: Highest estimate / Lowest estimate
No reference group &amp; adverse indicator: Lowest estimate / Highest estimate
Reference group &amp; favourable indicator: Reference estimate / Lowest estimate
Reference group &amp; adverse indicator: Lowest estimate / Reference estimate
</p>
<p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> R only assumes positive values. The further
the value of R from 1, the higher the level of inequality. R is 1 if
there is no inequality. R is a multiplicative measure and therefore results
should be displayed on a logarithmic scale. Values larger than 1 are
equivalent in magnitude to their reciprocal values smaller than 1 (e.g. a
value of 2 is equivalent in magnitude to a value of 0.5).
</p>
<p><strong>Type of summary measure:</strong> Simple; relative; unweighted
</p>
<p><strong>Applicability:</strong> Any dimension of inequality

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>RCI can be calculated using disaggregated data and individual-level data.
Subgroups in disaggregated data are weighted according to their population
share, while individuals are weighted by sample weight in the case of data
from surveys.
</p>
<p>The calculation of RCI is based on a ranking of the whole population from
the most disadvantaged subgroup (at rank 0) to the most advantaged subgroup
(at rank 1), which is inferred from the ranking and size of the subgroups.
RCI can be calculated as twice the covariance between the health indicator
and the relative rank, divided by the indicator mean. Given the relationship
between covariance and ordinary least squares regression, RCI can be
obtained from a regression of a transformation of the health variable of
interest on the relative rank. For more information on this inequality
measure see Schlotheuber (2022) below.
</p>
<p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> RCI is bounded between -1 and +1 (or between -100
and +100, when multiplied by 100). The larger the absolute value of RCI,
the higher the level of inequality. Positive values indicate a concentration
of the indicator among advantaged subgroups, and negative values indicate a
concentration of the indicator among disadvantaged subgroups. RCI is 0
if there is no inequality.
</p>
<p><strong>Type of summary measure:</strong> Complex; relative; weighted
</p>
<p><strong>Applicability:</strong> Ordered dimension of inequality with more than two
subgroups
</p>
<p><strong>Warning:</strong> The confidence intervals are approximate and might be biased.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>RII can be calculated using disaggregated data and individual-level data.
Subgroups in disaggregated data are weighted according to their population
share, while individuals are weighted by sample weight in the case of data
from surveys.
</p>
<p>To calculate RII, a weighted sample of the whole population is ranked from
the most disadvantaged subgroup (at rank 0) to the most advantaged subgroup
(at rank 1). This ranking is weighted, accounting for the proportional
distribution of the population within each subgroup. The indicator of
interest is then regressed against this relative rank using an appropriate
regression model, and the predicted values of the indicator are calculated
for the two extremes (rank 1 and rank 0). RII is calculated as the
ratio between the predicted values at rank 1 and rank 0 (covering the
entire distribution). For more information on this inequality measure see
Schlotheuber (2022) below.
</p>
<p>The default regression model used is a generalized linear model with logit
link. In logistic regression, the relationship between the indicator and the
subgroup rank is not assumed to be linear and, due to the logit link, the
predicted values from the regression model will be bounded between 0 and 1
(which is ideal for indicators measured as percentages). Specify Linear=TRUE
to use a linear regression model, which may be more appropriate for
indicators without a 0-1 or 0-100% scale.
</p>
<p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> RII takes only positive values. RII has the value of 1
if there is no inequality. Values larger than 1 indicate the level of the
indicator is higher among advantaged subgroups, and values lower than 1
indicate the level of the indicator is higher among disadvantaged subgroups.
Note that this results in different interpretations for favourable and
adverse indicators. RII is a multiplicative measure and therefore results
should be displayed on a logarithmic scale. Values larger than 1 are
equivalent in magnitude to their reciprocal values smaller than 1 (e.g. a
value of 2 is equivalent in magnitude to a value of 0.5).
</p>
<p><strong>Type of summary measure:</strong> Complex; relative; weighted
</p>
<p><strong>Applicability:</strong> Ordered dimension of inequality with more than two
subgroups
</p>
<p><strong>Warning:</strong> The confidence intervals are approximate and might be biased.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>TI measures the extent to which the shares of the population and shares of
the health indicator differ across subgroups, weighted by shares of the
health indicator. TI is calculated as the sum of products of the natural
logarithm of the share of the indicator of each subgroup, the share of the
indicator of each subgroup and the population share of each subgroup.
TI may be easily interpreted when multiplied by 1000. For more
information on this inequality measure see Schlotheuber (2022) below.
</p>
<p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> TI is 0 if there is no inequality. Greater absolute
values indicate higher levels of inequality. TI is more sensitive to
differences further from the setting average (by the use of the logarithm).
TI has no unit.
</p>
<p><strong>Type of summary measure:</strong> Complex; relative; weighted
</p>
<p><strong>Applicability:</strong> Non-ordered dimensions of inequality with more than two
subgroups
</p>
<p><strong>Warning:</strong> The confidence intervals are approximate and might be biased.
See Ahn (2018) below for further information on the standard error formula.
