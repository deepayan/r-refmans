<td>Description:</td>
<td>Addressing a central challenge encountered in Mendelian randomization (MR) studies, where MR primarily focuses on discerning the effects of individual exposures on specific outcomes and establishes causal links between them. Using a network-based methodology, the intricacy involving interdependent outcomes due to numerous factors has been tackled through this routine. Based on Ni et al. (2018) &lt;<a href="https://doi.org/10.1214%2F17-BA1087">doi:10.1214/17-BA1087</a>&gt;, 'MR.RGM' extends to a broader exploration of the causal landscape by leveraging on network structures and involves the construction of causal graphs that capture interactions between response variables and consequently between responses and instrument variables. 'MR.RGM' facilitates the navigation of various data availability scenarios effectively by accommodating three input formats, i.e., individual-level data and two types of summary-level data. In the process, causal effects, adjacency matrices, and other essential parameters of the complex biological networks, are estimated. Besides, 'MR.RGM' provides uncertainty quantification for specific network structures among response variables.</td>

<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr><td><code id="NetworkMotif_+3A_gamma">Gamma</code></td>
<td>
<p>A matrix of dimension p * p that signifies a specific network structure among the response variables, where p represents the number of response variables. This matrix is the focus of uncertainty quantification.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="NetworkMotif_+3A_gamma_pst">Gamma_Pst</code></td>
<td>
<p>An array of dimension p * p * n_pst, where n_pst is the number of posterior samples and p denotes the number of response variables. It comprises the posterior samples of the causal network among the response variables. This input might be obtained from the RGM function. Initially, execute the RGM function and save the resulting Gamma_Pst. Subsequently, utilize this stored Gamma_Pst as input for this function.</p>

</table>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The NetworkMotif function calculates the uncertainty quantification for the provided network structure. A value close to 1 indicates that the given network structure is frequently observed in the posterior samples, while a value close to 0 suggests that the given network structure is rarely observed in the posterior samples.

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The RGM function transforms causal inference by merging Mendelian randomization and network-based methods, enabling the creation of comprehensive causal graphs within complex biological systems. RGM accommodates varied data contexts with three input options: individual-level data (X, Y matrices), summary-level data including S_YY, S_YX, and S_XX matrices, and intricate data with challenging cross-correlations, utilizing S_XX, Beta, and Sigma_Hat matrices.
For the latter input, data centralization is necessary. Users can select any of these data formats to suit their needs and don’t have to specify all of them, allowing flexibility based on data availability. Crucial inputs encompass &quot;d&quot; (instrument count per response) and &quot;n&quot; (total observations, only required for summary level data), amplified by customizable parameters that refine analysis. Additionally, users can tailor the analysis by setting parameters such as &quot;nIter&quot; (number of MCMC iterations), &quot;nBurnin&quot; (number of discarded samples during burn-in for convergence), and &quot;Thin&quot; (thinning of posterior samples). These customizable parameters enhance the precision and relevance of the analysis.
RGM provides essential causal effect/strength estimates between response variables and between response and instrument variables. Moreover, it furnishes adjacency matrices, visually mapping causal graph structures. These outputs empower researchers to untangle intricate relationships within biological networks, fostering a holistic understanding of complex systems.
