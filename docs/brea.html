<h2 id='brea_mcmc'>Bayesian Discrete Survival Inference</h2><span id='topic+brea_mcmc'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function performs Metropolis-Hastings exploration of the posterior distribution for Bayesian discrete time survival models. The models may have competing risks, semiparametric covariate effects (like arbitrary baseline hazards), and random effects shared across repeated events and correlated across competing risks.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>brea_mcmc(x, y, priors = NULL, S = 1000, B = 100, n = NULL, K = NULL, store_re = FALSE)

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The data provided to the <code>brea_mcmc</code> function is specified at the person-time level: there is one row in <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> for each discrete time point each person or thing was at risk for event occurrence. All predictors in <code>x</code> must be encoded as factors or their corresponding integer codes. The underlying type of predictor is specified in the <code>priors</code> argument, which is a list with one element for each predictor variable which specifies both the type of that predictor and the prior distribution to use. The allowed predictor types are:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>"cat"</code> for categorical variables. The first element of the prior specification list is the string <code>"cat"</code>, and the second element is a positive conditional prior standard deviation parameter.
</p>
</li></ul>


<ul>
<li> <p><code>"gmrf"</code> for underlying continuous predictors; continuous predictors should be discretized with <code>cut()</code> before being included into <code>x</code>; Gaussian Markov random field (GMRF) priors are then used to smooth the effects of adjacent categories of the discretized continuous predictor. The first element of the prior specification list is the string <code>"gmrf"</code>, the second element is a prior degrees of freedom for the scaled inverse chi-squared prior for the random walk increment variance, and the third element is a prior scale for the scaled inverse chi-squared.
</p>
</li></ul>


<ul>
<li> <p><code>"re"</code> for variables (like subject id numbers) that represent random effects. The first element of the prior specification list is the string <code>"re"</code>, the second element is a prior degrees of freedom for an inverse Wishart prior for the random effects covariance, and the third element is a prior scale matrix for the random effects covariance.
</p>
</li></ul>


<ul>
<li> <p><code>"zero"</code> for predictors that are not used in the current MCMC run. This is provided as a convenient way to exclude predictors from certain runs. The first and only element of the prior specification list is the string <code>"zero"</code>.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list providing the values from each of the <code>S</code> post-burn-in MCMC iterations for the intercept, the other linear predictor parameters, standard deviations of the GMRF random walk increments, and covariances of the random effects:
</p>
<table role = "presentation">
<tr><td><code>b_0_s</code></td>
<td>
<p>an <code>R</code> by <code>S</code> matrix (where <code>R</code> is the number of competing risks) whose (r,s) entry is the intercept for risk r at MCMC iteration s</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>b_m_s</code></td>
<td>
<p>a list whose m^th element is the <code>R</code> by <code>K[m]</code> by <code>S</code> array whose (r,k,s) entry is the value of the linear predictor contribution of value k for predictor m on risk r at MCMC iteration s</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>s_m_s</code></td>
<td>
<p>a list whose m^th element is, in the case of a GMRF prior, the <code>R</code> by <code>S</code> matrix whose (r,s) entry is the random walk standard deviation for predictor m and competing risk r at MCMC iteration s, or, in the case of a random effects priors, the <code>R</code> by <code>R</code> by <code>S</code> array whose (,,s) entry is the random effects covariance matrix for predictor m at MCMC iteration s</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>b_m_a</code></td>
<td>
<p>a list whose m^th element is the length <code>K[m]</code> vector giving the number of accepted Metropolis proposals for each value of predictor m across all <code>S</code> post-burn-in MCMC iterations</p>
</td></tr>
