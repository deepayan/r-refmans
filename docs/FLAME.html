<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table role = "presentation">
<tr><td><code id="AME_+3A_data">data</code></td>
<td>
<p>Data to be matched. Either a data frame or a path to a .csv file
to be read into a data frame. Treatment must be described by a logical or
binary numeric column with name <code>treated_column_name</code>. If supplied,
outcome must be described by a column with name <code>outcome_column_name</code>.
The outcome will be treated as continuous if numeric with more than two
values, as binary if a two-level factor or numeric with values 0 and 1
exclusively, and as multi-class if a factor with more than two levels. If
the outcome column is omitted, matching will be performed but treatment
effect estimation will not be possible. All columns not containing outcome
or treatment will be treated as covariates for matching. Covariates are
assumed to be categorical and will be coerced to factors, though they may
be passed as either factors or numeric; if the former, unused levels will
automatically be dropped. If you wish to use continuous covariates for
matching, they should be binned prior to matching.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="AME_+3A_holdout">holdout</code></td>
<td>
<p>Holdout data to be used to compute predictive error, if
<code>weights</code> is not supplied. If a numeric scalar between 0 and 1, that
proportion of <code>data</code> will be made into a holdout set and only the
<em>remaining proportion</em> of <code>data</code> will be matched. Otherwise, a
data frame or a path to a .csv file. The holdout data must contain an
outcome column with name <code>outcome_column_name</code>; other restrictions on
column types are as for <code>data</code>. Covariate columns must have the same
column names and order as <code>data</code>. This data will <em>not</em> be
matched. Defaults to 0.1.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="AME_+3A_c">C</code></td>
<td>
<p>A finite, positive scalar denoting the tradeoff between BF and PE in
the FLAME algorithm. Higher C prioritizes more matches and lower C
prioritizes not dropping important covariates. Defaults to 0.1.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="AME_+3A_treated_column_name">treated_column_name</code></td>
<td>
<p>Name of the treatment column in <code>data</code> and
<code>holdout</code>. Defaults to 'treated'.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="AME_+3A_outcome_column_name">outcome_column_name</code></td>
<td>
<p>Name of the outcome column in <code>holdout</code> and
also in <code>data</code>, if supplied in the latter. Defaults to 'outcome'.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="AME_+3A_weights">weights</code></td>
<td>
<p>A positive numeric vector representing covariate importances.
Supplying this argument prevents PE from being computed as it determines
dropping order by forcing covariate subsets with lower weights to be
dropped first. The weight of a covariate subset is defined to be the sum of
the weights of the constituent covariates. Ties are broken at random.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="AME_+3A_pe_method">PE_method</code></td>
<td>
<p>Denotes how predictive error (PE) is to be computed. Either
a string &ndash; one of &quot;ridge&quot; (default) or &quot;xgb&quot; &ndash; or a function. If &quot;ridge&quot;,
ridge regression is used to fit a an outcome regression model via
<code>glmnet::cv.glmnet</code> with default parameters. If &quot;xgb&quot;, gradient
boosting with a wide range of parameter values to cross-validate is used
via <code>xgboost::xgb.cv</code> and the best parameters with respect to RMSE
(for continuous outcomes) or misclassification rate (for binary/multi-class
outcomes) are chosen. In both cases, the default <code>predict</code> method is
used to generate in-sample predictions. If a function, denotes a
user-supplied function that should be used for computing PE. This function
must be passed a data frame of covariates as its first argument and a
vector of outcome values as its second argument. It must return a vector of
in-sample predictions, which, if the outcome is binary or multi-class, must
be maximum probability class labels. See below for examples.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="AME_+3A_user_pe_fit">user_PE_fit</code></td>
<td>
<p>Deprecated; use argument 'PE_method' instead. An optional
function supplied by the user that can be used instead of those allowed for
by <code>PE_method</code> to fit a model for the outcome from the covariates.
This function will be passed a data frame of covariates
as its first argument and a vector of outcome values as its
second argument. See below for examples. Defaults to <code>NULL</code>.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="AME_+3A_user_pe_fit_params">user_PE_fit_params</code></td>
<td>
<p>Deprecated; use argument 'PE_method' instead. A
named list of optional parameters to be used by <code>user_PE_fit</code>.
Defaults to <code>NULL</code>.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="AME_+3A_user_pe_predict">user_PE_predict</code></td>
<td>
<p>Deprecated; use argument 'PE_method' instead. An
optional function supplied by the user that can be used to generate
predictions from the output of <code>user_PE_fit</code>. As its first argument,
must take an object of the type returned by <code>user_PE_fit</code> and as its
second, a matrix of values for which to generate predictions. When the
outcome is binary or multi-class, must return the maximum probability class
label. If not supplied, defaults to <code>predict</code>.</p>

<tr><td><code id="AME_+3A_replace">replace</code></td>
<td>
<p>A logical scalar. If <code>TRUE</code>, allows the same unit to be
matched multiple times, on different sets of covariates. In this case, the
balancing factor for <code>FLAME</code> is computing by dividing by the total
number of treatment (control) units, instead of the number of unmatched
treatment (control) units. Defaults to <code>FALSE</code>.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="AME_+3A_estimate_cates">estimate_CATEs</code></td>
<td>
<p>A logical scalar. If <code>TRUE</code>, CATEs for each unit
are estimated throughout the matching procedure, which will be much faster
than computing them after a call to <code>FLAME</code> or <code>DAME</code> for very
large inputs. Defaults to <code>FALSE</code>.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="AME_+3A_verbose">verbose</code></td>
<td>
<p>Controls how FLAME displays progress while running. If 0, no
output. If 1, only outputs the stopping condition. If 2, outputs the
iteration and number of unmatched units every 5 iterations, and the
stopping condition. If 3, outputs the iteration and number of unmatched
units every iteration, and the stopping condition. Defaults to 2.</p>
</td></tr>

exact matching is performed before stopping. Defaults to <code>Inf</code>.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="AME_+3A_early_stop_epsilon">early_stop_epsilon</code></td>
<td>
<p>A nonnegative numeric. If fixed covariate weights
are passed via <code>weights</code>, then the algorithm will stop before matching
on a covariate set whose error is above <code>early_stop_epsilon</code>, where in
this case the error is defined as: <code class="reqn">1 - weight(covariate set matched
on) / weight(all covariates)</code>. Otherwise, if <code>weights</code> is <code>NULL</code>,
if FLAME or DAME attempts to drop a covariate set that would raise the PE
above (1 + <code>early_stop_epsilon</code>) times the baseline PE (the PE before
any covariates have been dropped), the algorithm will stop. Defaults to
0.25.</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>FLAME and DAME are matching algorithms for
observational causal inference on data with discrete (categorical)
covariates. They match units that share identical values of certain
covariates, as follows. The algorithms first make any possible <em>exact</em>
matches; that is, they match units that share identical values of all
covariates (this is possible because covariates are discrete). They then
iteratively drop a set of covariates and make any possible matches on the
remaining covariates, until stopping. For each unit, DAME solves an
optimization problem that finds the highest quality set of covariates the
unit can be matched to others on, where quality is determined by how well
that set of covariates predicts the outcome. FLAME approximates the
solution to the problem solved by DAME; at each step, it drops the
covariate leading to the smallest drop in match quality <code class="reqn">MQ</code>, defined
as <code class="reqn">MQ = C · BF - PE</code>. Here, <code class="reqn">PE</code> denotes the predictive error,
which measures how important the dropped covariate is for predicting the
outcome. The balancing factor <code class="reqn">BF</code> measures the number of matches
formed by dropping that covariate. In this way, FLAME encourages matching
on covariates more important to the outcome and also making many matches.
The hyperparameter <code class="reqn">C</code> controls the balance between these two
objectives. In both cases, a machine learning algorithm trained on a
holdout dataset is responsible for learning the quality / importance of
covariates. For more details on the algorithms, please see the vignette,
the FLAME paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.06315.pdf">here</a> and/or
the DAME paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.06802.pdf">here</a>.
</p>


<h3>Stopping Rules</h3>

<p>By default, both <code>FLAME</code> and <code>DAME</code> stop
when 1. all covariates have been dropped or 2. all treatment or control
units have been matched. This behavior can be modified by the arguments
whose prefix is &quot;early_stop&quot;. With the exception of
<code>early_stop_iterations</code>, all the rules come into play <em>before</em>
the offending covariate set is dropped. For example, if
<code>early_stop_control = 0.2</code> and at the current iteration, dropping the
covariate leading to highest match quality is associated with a unmatched
control proportion of 0.1, FLAME will stop <em>without</em> dropping this
covariate.
</p>


<h3>Missing Data</h3>

<p><code>FLAME</code> and <code>DAME</code> offer functionality for
handling missing data in the covariates, for both the <code>data</code> and
<code>holdout</code> sets. This functionality can be specified via the arguments
whose prefix is &quot;missing&quot; or &quot;impute&quot;. It allows for ignoring missing data,
imputing it, or (for <code>data</code>) not matching on missing values. If
<code>data</code> is imputed, imputation will be done once and the matching
algorithm will be run on the imputed dataset. If <code>holdout</code> is imputed,
the predictive error at an iteration will be the average of predictive
errors across all imputed <code>holdout</code> datasets. Units with missingness
in the treatment or outcome will be dropped.
</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function returns CATE estimates and the estimated variances of such
estimates for <code>units</code> of interest. The CATE of a given unit is estimated
by the difference between the average treated and the average control outcome
in that unit's main matched group. As shown by Morucci 2021, under standard
regularity conditions, such an estimator is asymptotically normal and unbiased
for the true CATE, with a variance that can be estimated by the sum of the
variance of treated and control outcomes in the matched group, each normalized
by the number of treated and control units in the matched group, respectively.
Note that CATEs cannot be estimated for unmatched units and estimator
variances cannot be computed for units whose main matched group only contains
a single treated or control unit. Note also that these CATE estimates differ
from those that are used to compute average treatment effects in
<code>print.ame</code> and <code>summary.ame</code> and from those that will be returned
in <code>ame_out$data$CATE</code> if <code>estimate_CATEs = TRUE</code>. For a treated
(control) unit <code class="reqn">i</code>, the latter estimate the treated (control) outcome
conditioned on <code class="reqn">X = x_i</code> simply as <code class="reqn">Y_i</code>, and do not average across
other treated (control) units in the matched group as is done here. This
averaging is necessary in order to compute variance estimates. The different
estimates can always be manually compared, though they are the same in
expectation (assuming mean 0 noise) and we expect them to be similar in
practice, in the absence of large noise.
</p>
<p>Lastly, note that the <code>units</code> argument refers to units with respect to
<code>rownames(ame_out$data)</code>. Typically, this will also correspond to the
indexing of the data (i.e. passing <code>units = 3</code> will return the matched
group of the 3rd unit in the matching data). However, if a separate holdout
set was not passed to the matching algorithm or if the original matching data
had rownames other than <code>1:nrow(data)</code>, then this is not the case.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>gen_data</code> simulates data in the format accepted by <code><a href="#topic+FLAME">FLAME</a></code>
and <code>link{DAME}</code>. Covariates <code class="reqn">X_i</code> and treatment <code class="reqn">T</code> are both
independently generated according to a Bernoulli(0.5) distribution. The
outcome <code class="reqn">Y</code> is generated according to <code class="reqn">Y = 15X_1 - 10X_2 + 5X_3 + 5T
+ \epsilon</code>, where <code class="reqn">\epsilon \sim N(0, I_n)</code>. Thus, the value of <code>p</code>
must be at least 3 and any additional covariates beyond <code class="reqn">X_1, X_2, X_3</code>
are irrelevant.

<td>
<p>Defunct. Use 'id_only' instead.</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The <code>units</code> argument refers to units with respect to
<code>rownames(ame_out$data)</code>. Typically, this will also correspond to the
indexing of the data (i.e. passing <code>units = 3</code> will return the matched
group of the 3rd unit in the matching data). However, if a separate holdout
set was not passed to the matching algorithm or if the original matching data
had rownames other than <code>1:nrow(data)</code>, then this is not the case.
</p>
<p>The <code>multiple</code> argument toggles whether only a unit's main matched group
(MMG) or all matched groups a unit is part of should be returned. A unit's
MMG contains its highest quality matches (that is, the units with which it
first matched in the sequence of considered covariate sets). If the original
call that generated <code>ame_out</code> specified <code>replace = FALSE</code> then
units only are part of one matched group (which is also their MMG) and
<code>multiple</code> must be set to <code>FALSE</code>.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list of length <code>length(units)</code>, each entry of which corresponds to a
different unit in <code>units</code>. For matched units, if <code>multiple =
  FALSE</code>, each entry is 1. a data frame containing the treatment and outcome
information of members of the matched group, along with covariates they
were matched on if <code>id_only = FALSE</code> or 2. a vector of the IDs of
matched units if <code>id_only = TRUE</code> . If <code>multiple = TRUE</code>, each
entry of the returned list is a list containing the previously described
information, but with each entry corresponding to a different matched
group. In either case, entries corresponding to unmatched units are
<code>NULL</code>.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>## Not run: 
data &lt;- gen_data()
holdout &lt;- gen_data()
FLAME_out &lt;- FLAME(data = data, holdout = holdout, replace = TRUE)

# Only the main matched group of unit 1

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Plot information about numbers of covariates matched on, CATE estimates, and
covariate set dropping order after a call to <code>FLAME</code> or <code>DAME</code>.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>## S3 method for class 'ame'
plot(x, which_plots = c(1, 2, 3, 4), ...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table role = "presentation">
<tr><td><code id="plot.ame_+3A_x">x</code></td>
<td>
<p>An object of class <code>ame</code>, returned by a call to
<code><a href="#topic+FLAME">FLAME</a></code> or <code>link{DAME}</code>.</p>

</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="plot.ame_+3A_...">...</code></td>
<td>
<p>Additional arguments to passed on to other methods.</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>plot.ame</code> displays four plots by default. The first contains
information on the number of covariates that matched groups were formed on,
and thereby gives some indication of the quality of matched groups across the
matched data. The second plots matched group sizes against CATEs, which can
be useful for determining whether higher quality matched groups yield
different treatment effect estimates than lower quality ones. The third plots
a density estimate of the estimated CATE distribution. The fourth displays a
heatmap showing which covariates were dropped (shown in black) throughout the
matching procedure.

<h2 id='summary.ame'>Summarize the output of FLAME or DAME</h2><span id='topic+summary.ame'></span><span id='topic+print.summary.ame'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table role = "presentation">
<tr><td><code id="summary.ame_+3A_object">object</code></td>
<td>
<p>An object of class <code>ame</code>, returned by a call to
<code><a href="#topic+FLAME">FLAME</a></code> or <code><a href="#topic+DAME">DAME</a></code></p>

</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="summary.ame_+3A_digits">digits</code></td>
<td>
<p>Number of significant digits for printing the average treatment
effect estimates and their variances.</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The average treatment effect (ATE) is estimated as the average CATE estimate
across all matched units in the data, while the average treatment effect on
the treated (ATT) and average treatment effect on controls (ATC) average only
across matched treated or matched control units, respectively. Variances of
these estimates are computed as in Abadie, Drukker, Herr, and Imbens (The
Stata Journal, 2004) assuming constant treatment effect and homoscedasticity.
Note that the implemented estimator is <strong>not</strong> =asymptotically normal
and so in particular, asymptotically valid confidence intervals or hypothesis
tests cannot be conducted on its basis. In the future, the estimation
procedure will be changed to employ the nonparametric regression bias
adjustment estimator of Abadie and Imbens 2011 which is asymptotically
normal.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list of type <code>summary.ame</code> with the following entries:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>MG</dt><dd>
<p>A list with the number and median size of matched groups formed.
Additionally, two of the highest quality matched groups formed. Quality
is determined first by number of covariates matched on and second by
matched group size.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>n_matches</dt><dd>
<p>A matrix detailing the number of treated and control units matched.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>TEs</dt><dd>
<p>If the matching data had a continuous outcome, estimates of the ATE, ATT,
and ATC and the corresponding variance of the estimates.
