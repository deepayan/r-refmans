<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The data are from data from the 2017-2020 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (which was interrupted by COVID-19, so it is not a survey).  There were 5624 people who were at least 20 years of age, with an alcohol use survey, blood pressure measurements and covariates used here.  Blood pressure measurements are the average of up to three measurements.  One question asked about binge drinking in the past, defined as 4 drinks for women or 5 drinks for men.  Question ALQ151 asks (essentially): &quot;Was there ever a time or times in your life when you drank 4/5 or more drinks of any kind of alcoholic beverage almost every day?&quot;  Another question ALQ142 asked about binge drinking last year: &quot;During the past 12 months, about how often did you have 4/5 or more drinks of any alcoholic beverage?&quot;  Question ALQ121 about the overall frequency of alcohol consumption in the past 12 months. Proper use of ALQ121 and ALQ142 accounts for certain screening questions. By definition, group &quot;binge&quot; responded by saying that they engaged in binge drinking on 3 or more days each week in the past 12 months.  By definition, group &quot;never&quot; responded to ALQ142 saying they never binged in the past 12 months, responded to ALQ151 saying they had no past time when they binged almost every day, and drank any alcohol on at most one day a week in the past 12 months.  By definition, group &quot;past&quot; said yes to question ALQ151, so there was a period in their life of binge drinking almost every day, but they never binged in the past 12 months, and drank alcohol on at most one day a week in the past 12 months.
There were 9232 people aged 20 or more.  Of these, 9187 had covariate information, aside from BMI and waist/hip ratio.  Of these, 7876 had an alcohol survey.  Of these, 7281 had at least one measurement of diastolic and systolic blood pressure.  Of these, 7076 had body measurements, namely BMI and waist/hip ratio.  The three treatment groups &mdash; binge, never and past &mdash; are mutually exclusive but not exhaustive, and 5624 people fell in one of the groups.  All 207 members of the binge group were matched to one control from each control group.  Before matching, the never group had 3995 people and the past group had 505 people.  The never group was large enough to closely match two or three controls to each member of the binge group, but that was not done in this illustrative example.
Up to 3 repeated measures of blood pressure were often present, and the analysis uses their average.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>There is a debate about whether light daily alcohol consumption &ndash; a single glass of red wine &ndash; shortens or lengthens life.  LoConte et al. (2018) emphasize that alcohol is a carcinogen.  Suh et al. (1992) claim reduced cardiovascular mortality brought about by an increase in high density high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, the so-called good cholesterol.  There is on-going debate about whether there are cardiovascular benefits, and if they exist, whether they are large enough to offset an increased risk of cancer.  This example looks at a small corner of the larger debate, namely the effect on HDL cholesterol.
</p>
<p>The example contains several attempts to detect unmeasured confounding bias, if present.  There is a secondary outcome thought to be unaffected by alcohol consumption, namely methylmercury levels in the blood, likely an indicator of the consumption of fish, not of alcohol; see Pedersen et al. (1994) and WHO (2021).  There are also three control groups, all with little present alcohol consumption, but with different uses of alcohol in the past; see the definition of variable grp above.
</p>
<p>The appendix to Rosenbaum (2022a) describes the data and matching in detail.  It is used as an example in Rosenbaum (2022b).
</p>
<p>The help file for boxplotTT() applies the tail transformation to this example, reproducing a plot from Rosenbaum (2022b).
</p>
<p>This data set is also included in the tailTransform package.  See also the informedSen package which contains a part of this data set.

<h2 id='amplify'>
Amplification of sensitivity analysis in observational studies.
</h2><span id='topic+amplify'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Uses the method in Rosenbaum and Silber (2009) to interpret a value of the sensitivity parameter gamma.  Each value of gamma amplifies to a curve (lambda,delta) in a two-dimensional sensitivity analysis, the inference being the same for all points on the curve.
That is, a one-dimensional sensitivity analysis in terms of gamma has a two-dimensional interpretation in terms of (lambda,delta).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>amplify(gamma, lambda)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr><td><code id="amplify_+3A_gamma">gamma</code></td>
<td>

<p>gamma &gt; 1 is the value of the sensitivity parameter, for instance the parameter in senmv.  length(gamma)&gt;1 will generate an error.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="amplify_+3A_lambda">lambda</code></td>
<td>

<p>lambda is a vector of values &gt; gamma.  An error will result unless lambda[i] &gt; gamma &gt; 1 for every i.
</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>A single value of gamma, say gamma = 2.2 in the example, corresponds to a curve of values of (lambda, delta), including (3, 7),
(4, 4.33), (5, 3.57), and (7, 3) in the example.  An unobserved covariate that is associated with a lambda = 3 fold increase in the odds of treatment and a delta = 7 fold increase in the odds of a positive pair difference is equivalent to gamma = 2.2.
</p>
<p>The curve is gamma = (lambda*delta + 1)/(lambda+delta).  Amplify is given one gamma and a vector of lambdas and solves for the vector of deltas.  The calculation is elementary.
</p>
<p>This interpretation of gamma is developed in detail in Rosenbaum and Silber (2009), and it makes use of Wolfe's (1974) family of semiparametric deformations of an arbitrary symmetric distribuiton.  See also Rosenbaum (2020, Section 3.6).  For an elementary discussion, see Rosenbaum (2017, Table 9.1).
</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, the amplification describes matched pairs, not matched sets.  The senm function views a k-to-1 matched set with k controls matched to one treated individual as a collection of k correlated treated-minus-control matched pair differences; see Rosenbaum (2007).  For matched sets, it is natural to think of the amplification as describing any one of the k matched pair differences in a k-to-1 matched set.
</p>
<p>The curve has asymptotes that the function amplify does not compute: gamma corresponds with (lambda,delta) = (gamma, Inf) and (Inf, gamma).
</p>
<p>A related though distict idea is developed in Gastwirth et al (1998).  The two approaches agree when the outcome is binary, that is, for McNemar's test.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Returns a vector of values of delta of length(lambda) with names lambda.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>The amplify function is also in the sensitivitymv package where a different example is used.

groups is conducted as two nearly independent evidence factors; see Rosenbaum (2023b).  For this task, a suggested setting of m, m1, m2, scores and range is given in a note in the documentation below.  A simpler way to use the suggested settings is to use the function ef2C instead.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>dwgtRank(y, gamma = 1, m = 2, m1 = 2, m2 = 2, phifunc = NULL,
   alternative = "greater", scores = NULL, range = TRUE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr><td><code id="dwgtRank_+3A_y">y</code></td>

<p>With I blocks and J individuals in each block, y is and I x J matrix or dataframe containing the outcomes.  The first column of y is compared to columns 2, ..., J. J must be at least 2.
</p>

<p>An optional function that can be used to substitute your own weights for the weights defined by (m, m1, m2).  The function must map [0,1] into [0,1].  If phifunc is NULL, then the weight function is defined by (m, m1, m2).  If phifunc is not NULL, then it defines the weights and (m, m1, m2) are ignored.

<p>For an upper-tailed test, use the default, alternative=&quot;greater&quot;.  For an lower-tailed test, use alternative=&quot;less&quot;.  An error will result if alternative is something besides &quot;greater&quot; or &quot;less&quot;.  In this context, a two-sided test is best viewed as two one-sided tests with a Bonferroni correction, e.g., testing in both tails at level 0.025 to ensure overall level of 0.05; see Cox (1977).  For more information, see the notes.

<tr><td><code id="dwgtRank_+3A_scores">scores</code></td>

<p>If scores is NULL, the scores are 1, 2, ..., J.  Otherwise, scores should specify the J scores for the J within-block ranks.  If scores are specified, there must be J scores, but the J scores need not be distinct.

<p>If range=TRUE, then the within-block ranges are calculated, ranked from 1 to I, and scored (m, m1, m2) or phifunc.  If range=FALSE, then the within-block gap between the largest response and the average of the remaining J-1 responses is used instead.
</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The method uses a weighted rank statistic to compare the first column of y to the rest; see Rosenbaum (2023a,b).  Weighted rank statistics generalize the methods of Quade (1979) and Tardif (1987).  Quade (1979) applied unscored ranks to the I within block ranges, and used unscored ranks within-blocks.  In contrast, here, the scores of ranks of ranges or gaps are based on expression (9) in Rosenbaum (2011a); see also Rosenbaum (2014) where weighted M-statistics are used instead of weighted rank statistics.  If J=2, the method agrees exactly with the method for pairs in Rosenbaum (2011a).
</p>
<p>Using m=1, m1=1, m2=1, is the same as the stratified Wilcoxon rank sum with I strata, ignoring the ranges or gaps; see Lehmann 1975, Chapter 3).  Using m=2, m1=2, m2=2 applies unscored ranks to the I ranges or gaps.  Using m=5, m1=5, m2=5 is the suggestion of Conover and Salsburg (1988), and m=8, m1=8, m2=8 is a more extreme version of the same theme.  In pairs, J=2, m=8, m1=7, m2=8 performs well in Rosenbaum (2011a), as does m=8, m1=6, m2=8.  Detailed evaluations in terms of design sensitivity and Bahadur efficiency are in Rosenbaum (2023a,b).

<h3>Note</h3>

<p>SUGGESTED SETTINGS FOR m, m1, m2, range AND scores WHEN USED WITH TWO CONTROL GROUPS.  These suggested settings are more conveniently implemented in the function ef2C.  Rosenbaum (2023b) considered a matched block design with I blocks of size 3,
containing one treated individual and one control from each of two control
groups.  The two evidence factors are: (1) compare treated to the first control
group, and (2) compare the second control group to the pooled group that does
not distinguish the treated individual and the control from the first control
group.  For the matched pair comparison (1) with one control group,
the suggested settings are (m=8, m1=7, m2=8), together with the defaults of range=TRUE and scores=NULL; see Rosenbaum (2011a).  For comparison (2), Rosenbaum (2023b) evaluated 40 statistics, judging best the
statistic with (m=8, m1=8, m2=8), range=FALSE, scores=c(1,2,5), as illustrated
below.  This statistic had good Bahadur efficiency of a sensitivity analysis
against several simple alternative hypotheses involving a treatment effect
and no unmeasured bias.
</p>
<p>If we expect the treated group to have higher responses than controls,
then comparison (1) sets alternative to greater and comparison (2) sets
alternative to less.  If we expect the treated group to have lower responses than controls,
then comparison (1) sets alternative to less and comparison (2) sets
alternative to greater.  See also the note about alternatives.
</p>
<p>Suppose that the data are initially in an Ix3 matrix with outcomes
for treated in the first column, control group 1 in the second column, and
control group 2 in the third column.  The dwgtRank function always compares
the first column to the remaining columns.  So, the first factor applies the
function to y[,1:2] and the second factor applies the function to y[,3:1].  Note
carefully here that y[,3:1] has reversed the order of the columns, so column
3 is compared with the other two columns.
If the treatment is expected to cause an increase in the response, then
comparison (1) applies the function to y[,1:2] with alternative =
greater, and comparison (2) applies the function to y[,3:1] with
alternative = less.  This is illustrated in the example below which
reproduces analyses from Rosenbaum (2023b).  If the treatment is
expected to cause a decrease in the response, then repeat these steps
with y replaced by -y, so the treatment is expected to increase -y.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>ALTERNATIVE.  Setting alternative to less is the same as changing the sign of
the within-block scored rank, that is, changing phi(a_ij) to -phi(a_ij) in Rosenbaum (2023b); see especially equation (1) in the on-line supplement to that paper.  Note carefully that setting alternative to less does not change the between block ranks, even when range=FALSE.  In general, in dwgtRank, changing the alternative will give a different answer from changing y to -y
if range=FALSE because, unlike the range, the gap is not invariant to the sign
change.  I suggest using function ef2C &ndash; the recommended analysis &ndash; before trying out variations on that analysis using dwgtRank.
</p>
<p>The dwgtRank function was designed for the evidence factor analysis
with two different control groups in blocks of size 3, and this is reflected in the way alternative is defined when range=FALSE.  For a simple analysis in the suggested form, use ef2C instead of dwgtRank; it calls dwgtRank with appropriate settings.  If you wish to explore alternative settings for this problem, use dwgtRank.  For several controls from a single control group, use wgtRank instead of dwgtRank.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>TIES WITHIN BLOCKS.  If there are ties within blocks, then these are resolved as follows.
If scores are not specified, so the within block ranks are intended to be 1, 2, ..., J, then average ranks are used for ties.  If scores are specified, then ties are resolved by the ties.method=&quot;min&quot; in the rank function in base R.  This means that tied observations are all given the same rank, hence the same score, and that score corresponds with the smallest rank to which a tied group is entitled.  Suppose the scores are scores=c(1,2,5) for J=3.  If all three observations are different, then the smallest observation gets score 1, the middle gets 2, and the largest gets 5.  If the three values are, say, 16, 14, 14 in a block, they get ranks 3, 1, 1, with scores 5, 1, 1.  If the three values are 16, 16, 14 in a block, they get ranks 2, 2, 1, with scores 2, 2, 1.  This is in keeping with the idea that we want to emphasize those blocks in which one observation stands well above the rest.
In the example, there are no within-block ties, so the issue does not arise.
</p>
<p>TIES BETWEEN BLOCKS.  If there are ties among the I blocks in the within-block ranges or gaps, then average ranks are used for ties.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>This function compares the first column of y to the other columns.  To implement the second evidence factor analysis in Rosenbaum (2023b), the second control group must be placed in the first column.  See the examples, where y is y[,1:2] for the first evidence factor, but y becomes y[,3:1] for the second evidence factor.  All of this is automated in the function ef2C.

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>In an observational complete block design, with bocks of size three, each containing
a treated individual and one control from each of two control groups, ef2C performs
the evidence factor analysis suggested in Rosenbaum (2023).  One factor compares

other factor pools the treated group and the first control group and compares it
to the second control group.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This is the recommended analysis in Rosenbaum (2023).  The example below reproduces
some results from the example in that paper.  That paper considered 40 test statistics in terms of
the Bahadur efficiency of a sensitivity &ndash; all of these analyses can be
reproduced by the more flexible but more complicated dwgtRank function.
</p>
<p>The comparison of the treated group and the first control group is equivalent to
dwgtRank(y[,1:2],gamma=gamma,m=8,m1=7,m2=8,range=TRUE,alternative=&quot;greater&quot;), and
these settings are motivated by results in Rosenbaum (2011, 2015).  Notice that
y[,1:2] uses the first two columns of y.
</p>
<p>The comparison of the second control group and the merger of the treated group
with the first control group is equivalent to
dwgtRank(y[,3:1], gamma=upsilon, m=8,m1=8,m2=8, range=FALSE, alternative=&quot;less&quot;, scores=c(1,2,5)), and  these settings are motivated by results in Rosenbaum (2023).  Notice that
y[,3:1] compares the third column to the pooled group consisting of columns 1 and 2.

<h3>Note</h3>

<p>The two P-values from the two factors are combined using the trucated product of P-values due to Zaykin et al. (2002): it is the P-value derived from the product of those P-values that are less
than trunc.  Taking trunc=1 yields Fisher's method for combining independent P-values.  Fisher's method is not ideal when combining P-value bounds produced by sensitivity analyses; see Hsu et al. (2013).  Reasonable values are trunc=.1, truc=.15 and trunc=.2.  As illustrated in the example
below, lower truncation values produce smaller combined P-values when the P-values are
below the truncation point, but a P-value that barely exceeds the truncation point
is effectively discarded.  Hsu et al. (2013) compare truncation values when used in a sensitivity analysis.  For discussion of combining sensitivity analyses as
independent, see the required conditions in Rosenbaum (2011b, 2021).  These conditions
hold for the comparison performed by ef2C.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>The setting alternative = &quot;less&quot; simply replaces y by -y before testing in the
upper tail.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>For a deeper understanding, see the documentation of dwgtRank.  That function
is more general, but it requires more attention to detail by the user.  The
documentation for dwgtRank also produces additional analyses from Rosenbaum (2023).

<p>The package conducts either fixed or adaptive sensitivity analyses for observational studies with I blocks and J individuals in each block, one treated and J-1 controls.  The two main functions are wgtRank() for a fixed test statistic, and wgtRanktt() for an adaptive choice of one of two test statistics.  The function ef2C() is used to extract two evidence factors when a treated group
is compared to two different control groups.

Sensitivity Analysis for Weighted Rank Statistics in Block Designs
</h2><span id='topic+wgtRank'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Uses a weighted rank statistic to perform a sensitivity analysis for an I x J observational block design in which each of I blocks contains one treated individual and J-1 controls.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>wgtRank(y, phi = "u868", phifunc = NULL, gamma = 1)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr><td><code id="wgtRank_+3A_y">y</code></td>
<td>

<p>A matrix or data frame with I rows and J columns.  Column 1 contains the response of the treated individuals and columns 2 throught J contain the responses of controls in the same block.  A error will result if y contains NAs.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="wgtRank_+3A_phi">phi</code></td>
<td>

<p>The weight function to be applied to the ranks of the within block ranges.  The options are: (i) &quot;wilc&quot; for the stratified Wilcoxon test, which gives every block the same weight, (ii) &quot;quade&quot; which ranks the within block ranges from 1 to I, and is closely related to Quade's (1979) statistic; see also Tardif (1987), (iii) &quot;u868&quot; based on Rosenbaum (2011), (iv) u878 based on Rosenbaum (2011).  Note that phi is ignored if phifunc is not NULL.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="wgtRank_+3A_phifunc">phifunc</code></td>
<td>
<p> If not NULL, a user specified weight function for the ranks of the within block rates.  The function should map [0,1] into [0,1].  The function is applied to the ranks divided by the sample size.  See the example.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="wgtRank_+3A_gamma">gamma</code></td>
<td>

<p>A single number greater than or equal to 1.  gamma is the sensitivity parameter.  Two individuals with the same observed covariates may differ in their odds of treatment by at most a factor of gamma; see Rosenbaum (1987; 2017, Chapter 9).
</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This method is developed and evaluated in Rosenbaum (2022).
</p>
<p>To test in the lower tail &ndash; to test against the alternative that treated responses are lower than control responses, apply the function to -y.  For a two-sided test, do both one-sided tests and apply the Bonferroni inequality, doubling the smaller of the two one-sided P-value bounds; see Cox (1977, Section 4.2).
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<table>
<tr><td><code>pval</code></td>
<td>
<p>Upper bound on the one-sided P-value when testing
the null hypothesis of no treatment effect against the alternative hypothesis that treated responses are higher than control responses.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>detail</code></td>
<td>
<p>Details of the computation of pval: the standardized deviate, the test statistic, its null expectation, its null variance and the value of gamma.</p>
</td></tr>

<h3>Note</h3>

<p>The computations use the separable approximation discussed in Gastwirth et al. (2000) and Rosenbaum (2018).  Compare with the method in Rosenbaum (2014) and the R package sensitivitymw.

<h3>Note</h3>

<p>For discussion of testing twice in matched pairs, see Rosenbaum (2012).
</p>
<p>Testing twice is also possible in block designs using weighted rank statistics because the same value of the unobserved covariate provides the upper bound for both statistics when using the separable approximation in Gastwirth et al. (2000) and Rosenbaum (2018, Remarks 4 and 5).  See also Rosenbaum (2022) where the Bahadur efficiency of such tests is computed.
</p>
<p>Other packages that use testing twice in a different way are &quot;sensitivity2x2xk&quot;&quot; and &quot;testtwice&quot;.  The &quot;testtwice&quot; package is restricted to matched pairs, and &quot;sensitivity2x2xk&quot;&quot; is for binary outcomes.  With some attention to detail (e.g., the handling of zero pair differences), in the case of matched pairs, the &quot;testtwice&quot; package and the wgtRanktt() function will yield identical results.  In that sense, wgtRanktt() extends the method to blocks designs.
</p>
<p>Testing twice achieves the larger Bahadur efficiency of the two component statistics; see Berk and Jones (1978).

# This is the simplest example of a general property.  The
# example simply illustrates, but does not fully exploit
# the property.  In this case, use of the stratified
# Wilcoxon statistic is a mistake, because Quade's
# statistic correctly reports insensitivity to a bias
# of gamma=4.5, but the stratified Wilcoxon statistic
# is sensitive at gamma=3.5.  The adaptive procedure
# that does both tests and corrects for multiple testing
# is insensitive to gamma=4.4; so, it is almost as good
# as knowing what you cannot know, namely that Quade's
# statistic is the better choice in this one example.
# The price paid for testing twice is very small;
# see Berk and Jones (1978) and Rosenbaum (2012, 2022).

# In this example, u878 exhibits greater insensitivity to bias
# than u868.  However, adaptive inference using both is almost
# as good as the better statistic, yet it strongly controls the
# family-wise error rate despite testing twice;
# see Rosenbaum (2012,2022).
wgtRank(y,phi="u868",gamma=6) # New U-statistic weights (8,6,8)

# A user defined weight function, brown, analogous to Brown (1981).
brown&lt;-function(v){((v&gt;=.333)+(v&gt;=.667))/2}
# In this example, the joint test rejects based on u878
