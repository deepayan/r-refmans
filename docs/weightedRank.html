</pre>
<p>The package conducts either fixed or adaptive sensitivity analyses for observational studies with I blocks and J individuals in each block, one treated and J-1 controls.  The two main functions are wgtRank() for a fixed test statistic, and wgtRanktt() for an adaptive choice of one of two test statistics.  The function wgtRankCI() inverts the test to obtain confidence intervals and Hodges-Lehmann point estimates.  The function ef2C() is used to extract two evidence factors when a treated group
is compared to two different control groups.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The data are from data from the 2017-2020 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (which was interrupted by COVID-19, so it is not a survey).  There were 5624 people who were at least 20 years of age, with an alcohol use survey, blood pressure measurements and covariates used here.  Blood pressure measurements are the average of up to three measurements.  One question asked about binge drinking in the past, defined as 4 drinks for women or 5 drinks for men.  Question ALQ151 asks (essentially): &quot;Was there ever a time or times in your life when you drank 4/5 or more drinks of any kind of alcoholic beverage almost every day?&quot;  Another question ALQ142 asked about binge drinking last year: &quot;During the past 12 months, about how often did you have 4/5 or more drinks of any alcoholic beverage?&quot;  Question ALQ121 about the overall frequency of alcohol consumption in the past 12 months. Proper use of ALQ121 and ALQ142 accounts for certain screening questions. By definition, group &quot;binge&quot; responded by saying that they engaged in binge drinking on 3 or more days each week in the past 12 months.  By definition, group &quot;never&quot; responded to ALQ142 saying they never binged in the past 12 months, responded to ALQ151 saying they had no past time when they binged almost every day, and drank any alcohol on at most one day a week in the past 12 months.  By definition, group &quot;past&quot; said yes to question ALQ151, so there was a period in their life of binge drinking almost every day, but they never binged in the past 12 months, and drank alcohol on at most one day a week in the past 12 months.
There were 9232 people aged 20 or more.  Of these, 9187 had covariate information, aside from BMI and waist/hip ratio.  Of these, 7876 had an alcohol survey.  Of these, 7281 had at least one measurement of diastolic and systolic blood pressure.  Of these, 7076 had body measurements, namely BMI and waist/hip ratio.  The three treatment groups &mdash; binge, never and past &mdash; are mutually exclusive but not exhaustive, and 5624 people fell in one of the groups.  All 207 members of the binge group were matched to one control from each control group.  Before matching, the never group had 3995 people and the past group had 505 people.  The never group was large enough to closely match two or three controls to each member of the binge group, but that was not done in this illustrative example.
Up to 3 repeated measures of blood pressure were often present, and the analysis uses their average.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>There is a debate about whether light daily alcohol consumption &ndash; a single glass of red wine &ndash; shortens or lengthens life.  LoConte et al. (2018) emphasize that alcohol is a carcinogen.  Suh et al. (1992) claim reduced cardiovascular mortality brought about by an increase in high density high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, the so-called good cholesterol.  There is on-going debate about whether there are cardiovascular benefits, and if they exist, whether they are large enough to offset an increased risk of cancer.  This example looks at a small corner of the larger debate, namely the effect on HDL cholesterol.
</p>
<p>The example contains several attempts to detect unmeasured confounding bias, if present.  There is a secondary outcome thought to be unaffected by alcohol consumption, namely methylmercury levels in the blood, likely an indicator of the consumption of fish, not of alcohol; see Pedersen et al.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This data set enlarges the aHDL data in this package to include also data from
NHANES 2017-2020.  The aHDL data included 406 blocks of 4 people from NHANES
2013-2016, and they are included in aHDLe.  From NHANES 2017-2020,
an additional 316 blocks of 4 people were added, making 722 blocks of size 4
in total.
</p>
<p>The alcohol questions changed slightly in NHANES 2017-2020, forcing small
changes in the definitions of two of the control groups.  See the Note for specifics.
</p>
<p>There is a debate about whether light daily alcohol consumption &ndash; a single glass of red wine &ndash; shortens or lengthens life.  LoConte et al. (2018) emphasize that alcohol is a carcinogen.  Suh et al. (1992) claim reduced cardiovascular mortality brought about by an increase in high density high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, the so-called good cholesterol.  There is on-going debate about whether there are cardiovascular benefits, and if they exist, whether they are large enough to offset an increased risk of cancer.  This example looks at a small corner of the larger debate, namely the effect on HDL cholesterol.
</p>
<p>The example contains several attempts to detect unmeasured confounding bias, if present.  There is a secondary outcome thought to be unaffected by alcohol consumption, namely methylmercury levels in the blood, likely an indicator of the consumption of fish, not of alcohol; see Pedersen et al. (1994) and WHO (2021).  There are also three control groups, all with little present alcohol consumption, but with different uses of alcohol in the past; see the definition of variable grp above.
</p>
<p>The appendix to Rosenbaum (2023) describes the 2013-2016 data and matching in detail.  See also the documentation in this package for the aHDL data.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>There is a treated group and three control groups, with one member of each group in each of 722 blocks.  Of these, 406 blocks came from NHANES 2013-2016 and 316 blocks
came from NHANES 2017-2020, making 722=406+316 blocks in total.
</p>
<p>In all three NHANES surveys, 2013-2014, 2015-2016 and 2017-2020, groups D and B
had the same definition, as described in the data appendix to Rosenbaum (2023).
Specifically:
</p>
<p>D=Daily alcohol.  Drank alcohol on most days, meaning at least 260 = 5 x 52 days in the past year, drinking between 1 and 3 alcoholic drinks on drinking days.
</p>
<p>B=Past binge drinker.  An individual in this control group had a period in
their life when they drank at least 4 or 5 drinks on most days, but quit,
and now drinks on at most one day a week, or at most 52 days in the past year.
</p>
<p>NHANES slightly changed its alcohol questions in 2017-2020, so that small changes
were required in the definitions of the other two control groups.  NHANES 2013-2016 had asked whether a person had &quot;12 drinks in their life,&quot; but in 2017-2020 NHANES
asked whether a person had &quot;ever had a drink&quot;.  These were screen questions, so little was asked of a person about alcohol consumption if the person said at the outset that they had never had much alcohol.  As it turned out, a yes to the old question, &quot;fewer than 12 drinks in their life,&quot; was fairly common, but a yes to the new question, &quot;never had one drink,&quot; was much less common. This affects the definitions of groups N=never and R=rare drinking.
</p>
<p>As described in greater detail in the data appendix to Rosenbaum (2023), for NHANES 2013-2016, group N=never
was comprised of people who said they had fewer than 12 drinks in their life.  In
the expansion to include data from NHANES 2017-2020, group N=never was comprised
of people who either (i) never had a drink of alcohol, or (ii) had 0 alcoholic
drinks in the past year and never in their life had a period of regular binge
drinking on most days, defined to be at least 4 or 5 drinks per day.
</p>
<p>As described in greater detail in the data appendix to Rosenbaum (2023), for NHANES 2013-2016, group R=&quot;rare drinking&quot; was comprised of people who did have 12 or more drinks in their life,
but had fewer than 12 drinks in the past year, and never in their life had a period of regular binge drinking on most days, defined to be at least 4 or 5 drinks per day.
In the expansion to include data from NHANES 2017-2020, group R=&quot;rare drinking&quot;
drank between 1 and 11 alcoholic drinks in the past year and never in their life had a period of regular binge drinking on most days, defined to be at least 4 or 5 drinks per day.
</p>
<p>In brief, everyone in control groups N and R reports drinking little or no alcohol
in the past year.  No one in groups N and R reports a period in their lives
when they engaged in binge drinking on most days.  As nearly as possible given
the questions asked, group N appears to be abstaining from alcohol, at least in the
past year.  As nearly as possible given the questions asked, group R appears
to be open to having a rare drink at a wedding or a wake, but drank a negligible
amount of alcohol in the past year.  Yet, the exact definitions of control groups N and R are slightly different for NHANES 2017-2020. In each block, everyone was given the same structured questions by NHANES, so differences between questions occur between
blocks, not within blocks.

<h2 id='amplify'>
Amplification of sensitivity analysis in observational studies.
</h2><span id='topic+amplify'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Uses the method in Rosenbaum and Silber (2009) to interpret a value of the sensitivity parameter gamma.  Each value of gamma amplifies to a curve (lambda,delta) in a two-dimensional sensitivity analysis, the inference being the same for all points on the curve.
That is, a one-dimensional sensitivity analysis in terms of gamma has a two-dimensional interpretation in terms of (lambda,delta).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>amplify(gamma, lambda)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table role = "presentation">
<tr><td><code id="amplify_+3A_gamma">gamma</code></td>
<td>

<p>gamma &gt; 1 is the value of the sensitivity parameter, for instance the parameter in senmv.  length(gamma)&gt;1 will generate an error.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="amplify_+3A_lambda">lambda</code></td>
<td>

<p>lambda is a vector of values &gt; gamma.  An error will result unless lambda[i] &gt; gamma &gt; 1 for every i.
</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>A single value of gamma, say gamma = 2.2 in the example, corresponds to a curve of values of (lambda, delta), including (3, 7),
(4, 4.33), (5, 3.57), and (7, 3) in the example.  An unobserved covariate that is associated with a lambda = 3 fold increase in the odds of treatment and a delta = 7 fold increase in the odds of a positive pair difference is equivalent to gamma = 2.2.
</p>
<p>The curve is gamma = (lambda*delta + 1)/(lambda+delta).  Amplify is given one gamma and a vector of lambdas and solves for the vector of deltas.  The calculation is elementary.
</p>
<p>This interpretation of gamma is developed in detail in Rosenbaum and Silber (2009), and it makes use of Wolfe's (1974) family of semiparametric deformations of an arbitrary symmetric distribuiton.  See also Rosenbaum (2020, Section 3.6).  For an elementary discussion, see Rosenbaum (2017, Table 9.1).
</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, the amplification describes matched pairs, not matched sets.  The senm function views a k-to-1 matched set with k controls matched to one treated individual as a collection of k correlated treated-minus-control matched pair differences; see Rosenbaum (2007).  For matched sets, it is natural to think of the amplification as describing any one of the k matched pair differences in a k-to-1 matched set.
</p>
<p>The curve has asymptotes that the function amplify does not compute: gamma corresponds with (lambda,delta) = (gamma, Inf) and (Inf, gamma).
</p>
<p>A related though distict idea is developed in Gastwirth et al (1998).  The two approaches agree when the outcome is binary, that is, for McNemar's test.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Returns a vector of values of delta of length(lambda) with names lambda.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>The amplify function is also in the sensitivitymv package where a different example is used.

Weighted Rank Statistics for Evidence Factors with Two Control Groups
</h2><span id='topic+dwgtRank'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>In an observational complete block design, dwgtRank computes a sensitivity analysis for a weighted rank statistic designed to perform well when the comparison of a treated group and two control
groups is conducted as two nearly independent evidence factors; see Rosenbaum (2023).  For this task, a suggested setting of m, m1, m2, scores and range is given in a note in the documentation below.  A simpler way to use the suggested settings is to use the function ef2C instead.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>dwgtRank(y, gamma = 1, m = 2, m1 = 2, m2 = 2, phifunc = NULL,
   alternative = "greater", scores = NULL, range = TRUE)

<p>An optional function that can be used to substitute your own weights for the weights defined by (m, m1, m2).  The function must map [0,1] into [0,1].  If phifunc is NULL, then the weight function is defined by (m, m1, m2).  If phifunc is not NULL, then it defines the weights and (m, m1, m2) are ignored.
</p>

<tr><td><code id="dwgtRank_+3A_alternative">alternative</code></td>
<td>

<p>For an upper-tailed test, use the default, alternative=&quot;greater&quot;.  For an lower-tailed test, use alternative=&quot;less&quot;.  An error will result if alternative is something besides &quot;greater&quot; or &quot;less&quot;.  In this context, a two-sided test is best viewed as two one-sided tests with a Bonferroni correction, e.g., testing in both tails at level 0.025 to ensure overall level of 0.05; see Cox (1977).  For more information, see the notes.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="dwgtRank_+3A_scores">scores</code></td>
<td>

<p>If scores is NULL, the scores are 1, 2, ..., J.  Otherwise, scores should specify the J scores for the J within-block ranks.  If scores are specified, there must be J scores, but the J scores need not be distinct.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="dwgtRank_+3A_range">range</code></td>
<td>

<p>If range=TRUE, then the within-block ranges are calculated, ranked from 1 to I, and scored (m, m1, m2) or phifunc.  If range=FALSE, then the within-block gap between the largest response and the average of the remaining J-1 responses is used instead.
</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The method uses a weighted rank statistic to compare the first column of y to the rest; see Rosenbaum (2023, 2024).  Weighted rank statistics generalize the methods of Quade (1979) and Tardif (1987).  Quade (1979) applied unscored ranks to the I within block ranges, and used unscored ranks within-blocks.  In contrast, here, the scores of ranks of ranges or gaps are based on expression (9) in Rosenbaum (2011a); see also Rosenbaum (2014) where weighted M-statistics are used instead of weighted rank statistics.  If J=2, the method agrees exactly with the method for pairs in Rosenbaum (2011a).
</p>
<p>Using m=1, m1=1, m2=1, is the same as the stratified Wilcoxon rank sum with I strata, ignoring the ranges or gaps; see Lehmann 1975, Chapter 3).  Using m=2, m1=2, m2=2 applies unscored ranks to the I ranges or gaps.  Using m=5, m1=5, m2=5 is the suggestion of Conover and Salsburg (1988), and m=8, m1=8, m2=8 is a more extreme version of the same theme.  In pairs, J=2, m=8, m1=7, m2=8 performs well in Rosenbaum (2011a), as does m=8, m1=6, m2=8.  Detailed evaluations in terms of design sensitivity and Bahadur efficiency are in Rosenbaum (2023, 2024).

<p>SUGGESTED SETTINGS FOR m, m1, m2, range AND scores WHEN USED WITH TWO CONTROL GROUPS.  These suggested settings are more conveniently implemented in the function ef2C.  Rosenbaum (2023) considered a matched block design with I blocks of size 3,
containing one treated individual and one control from each of two control
groups.  The two evidence factors are: (1) compare treated to the first control
group, and (2) compare the second control group to the pooled group that does
not distinguish the treated individual and the control from the first control
group.  For the matched pair comparison (1) with one control group,
the suggested settings are (m=8, m1=7, m2=8), together with the defaults of range=TRUE and scores=NULL; see Rosenbaum (2011a).  For comparison (2), Rosenbaum (2023) evaluated 40 statistics, judging best the
statistic with (m=8, m1=8, m2=8), range=FALSE, scores=c(1,2,5), as illustrated
below.  This statistic had good Bahadur efficiency of a sensitivity analysis
against several simple alternative hypotheses involving a treatment effect
and no unmeasured bias.
</p>
<p>If we expect the treated group to have higher responses than controls,
then comparison (1) sets alternative to greater and comparison (2) sets
alternative to less.  If we expect the treated group to have lower responses than controls,
then comparison (1) sets alternative to less and comparison (2) sets
alternative to greater.  See also the note about alternatives.
</p>
<p>Suppose that the data are initially in an Ix3 matrix with outcomes
for treated in the first column, control group 1 in the second column, and
control group 2 in the third column.  The dwgtRank function always compares
the first column to the remaining columns.  So, the first factor applies the
function to y[,1:2] and the second factor applies the function to y[,3:1].  Note
carefully here that y[,3:1] has reversed the order of the columns, so column
3 is compared with the other two columns.
If the treatment is expected to cause an increase in the response, then
comparison (1) applies the function to y[,1:2] with alternative =
greater, and comparison (2) applies the function to y[,3:1] with
alternative = less.  This is illustrated in the example below which
reproduces analyses from Rosenbaum (2023).  If the treatment is
expected to cause a decrease in the response, then repeat these steps
with y replaced by -y, so the treatment is expected to increase -y.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>ALTERNATIVE.  Setting alternative to less is the same as changing the sign of
the within-block scored rank, that is, changing phi(a_ij) to -phi(a_ij) in Rosenbaum (2023); see especially equation (1) in the on-line supplement to that paper.  Note carefully that setting alternative to less does not change the between block ranks, even when range=FALSE.  In general, in dwgtRank, changing the alternative will give a different answer from changing y to -y
if range=FALSE because, unlike the range, the gap is not invariant to the sign
change.  I suggest using function ef2C &ndash; the recommended analysis &ndash; before trying out variations on that analysis using dwgtRank.
</p>
<p>The dwgtRank function was designed for the evidence factor analysis
with two different control groups in blocks of size 3, and this is reflected in the way alternative is defined when range=FALSE.  For a simple analysis in the suggested form, use ef2C instead of dwgtRank; it calls dwgtRank with appropriate settings.  If you wish to explore alternative settings for this problem, use dwgtRank.  For several controls from a single control group, use wgtRank instead of dwgtRank.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>TIES WITHIN BLOCKS.  If there are ties within blocks, then these are resolved as follows.
If scores are not specified, so the within block ranks are intended to be 1, 2, ..., J, then average ranks are used for ties.  If scores are specified, then ties are resolved by the ties.method=&quot;min&quot; in the rank function in base R.  This means that tied observations are all given the same rank, hence the same score, and that score corresponds with the smallest rank to which a tied group is entitled.  Suppose the scores are scores=c(1,2,5) for J=3.  If all three observations are different, then the smallest observation gets score 1, the middle gets 2, and the largest gets 5.  If the three values are, say, 16, 14, 14 in a block, they get ranks 3, 1, 1, with scores 5, 1, 1.  If the three values are 16, 16, 14 in a block, they get ranks 2, 2, 1, with scores 2, 2, 1.  This is in keeping with the idea that we want to emphasize those blocks in which one observation stands well above the rest.
In the example, there are no within-block ties, so the issue does not arise.
</p>
<p>TIES BETWEEN BLOCKS.  If there are ties among the I blocks in the within-block ranges or gaps, then average ranks are used for ties.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>This function compares the first column of y to the other columns.  To implement the second evidence factor analysis in Rosenbaum (2023), the second control group must be placed in the first column.  See the examples, where y is y[,1:2] for the first evidence factor, but y becomes y[,3:1] for the second evidence factor.  All of this is automated in the function ef2C.

Evidence Factors For Matched Triples With Two Control Groups
</h2><span id='topic+ef2C'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>In an observational complete block design, with bocks of size three, each containing
a treated individual and one control from each of two control groups, ef2C (with the default settings) performs
the evidence factor analysis suggested in Rosenbaum (2023).  One factor compares
the treated group to the first control group in a matched pairs analysis.  The
other factor pools the treated group and the first control group and compares it
to the second control group.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>ef2C(y, gamma=1, upsilon=1, alternative="greater", trunc=0.2,
    m=c(8,8), m1=c(7,8), m2=c(8,8), scores=c(1,2,5), range=FALSE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table role = "presentation">
<tr><td><code id="ef2C_+3A_y">y</code></td>
<td>

<p>With I blocks and 3 individuals in each block, y is and I x 3 matrix or dataframe containing the outcomes.  The first column is the response of the treated individual.  The second response is the response of the control from the first control group.  The third response is the response of the control from the second control group.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="ef2C_+3A_gamma">gamma</code></td>
<td>

<p>A real number &gt;=1 giving the value of the sensitivity parameter for the comparison of the treated group and the first control group.  gamma=1 yields a randomization test.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="ef2C_+3A_upsilon">upsilon</code></td>
<td>

<p>A real number &gt;=1 giving the value of the sensitivity parameter for the comparison of the second control group and the combination of the treated group plus the first control group.  upsilon=1 yields a randomization test.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="ef2C_+3A_alternative">alternative</code></td>
<td>

<p>Use alternative=greater if the treatment is expect to cause an increase in the response in y.
Use alternative=less if the treatment is expect to cause a decrease in the response in y.  In this context, a two-sided test is best viewed as two one-sided tests with a Bonferroni correction, e.g., testing in both tails at level 0.025 to ensure overall level of 0.05; see Cox (1977).  For more information, see the notes.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="ef2C_+3A_trunc">trunc</code></td>
<td>

<p>The two P-values from the two factors are combined using the trucated product of P-values due to Zaykin et al. (2002): it is the P-value derived from the product of those P-values that are less
than trunc.  For more information, see the notes.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="ef2C_+3A_m">m</code></td>
<td>

<p>A vector of two integers greater than or equal to 1.  The first coordinate of m is for the first evidence factor, comparing the treated individual to the control from the first control group.  The second coordinate of m is for the second evidence factor, comparing the control from the second control group to the set containing the treated individual and the first control.  One of three parameters that define the weights that attach to blocks.  The three parameters are integers with 1 &lt;= m1[1] &lt;= m2[1] &lt;= m[1] and 1 &lt;= m1[2] &lt;= m2[2] &lt;= m[2].  The default settings are
suggested in Rosenbaum (2023).  See Details.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="ef2C_+3A_m1">m1</code></td>
<td>

<p>A vector of two integers greater than or equal to 1.  See m.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="ef2C_+3A_m2">m2</code></td>
<td>

<p>A vector of two integers greater than or equal to 1.  See m.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="ef2C_+3A_scores">scores</code></td>
<td>

<p>A vector of three nonnegative integer scores used to rank the three responses in each block in the test concerning the second evidence factor.  The default settings are
suggested in Rosenbaum (2023).  See Details.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="ef2C_+3A_range">range</code></td>
<td>

<p>A TRUE or a FALSE for the second evidence factor.  If TRUE, blocks are ranked by their within-block ranges.  If FALSE, blocks are ranked by the so-called gap, which is the difference between the maximum order statistic in a block and the average of the remaining order statistics.  The default setting of FALSE is
suggested in Rosenbaum (2023).  See Details.
</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The default settings produce the recommended evidence-factor analysis in Rosenbaum (2023).  The example below reproduces
some results from the example in that paper.  That paper considered 40 test statistics in terms of
the Bahadur efficiency of a sensitivity &ndash; all of these analyses can be reproduced by the more flexible but more complicated dwgtRank function.  The ef2C function calls dwgtRank twice and combines the
resulting two analyses.
</p>
<p>The comparison of the treated group and the first control group is equivalent to
dwgtRank(y[,1:2],gamma=gamma,m=8,m1=7,m2=8,range=TRUE,alternative=&quot;greater&quot;), and
these settings are motivated by results in Rosenbaum (2011, 2015).  Notice that
y[,1:2] uses the first two columns of y.
</p>
<p>The comparison of the second control group and the merger of the treated group
with the first control group is equivalent to
dwgtRank(y[,3:1], gamma=upsilon, m=8,m1=8,m2=8, range=FALSE, alternative=&quot;less&quot;, scores=c(1,2,5)), and  these settings are motivated by results in Rosenbaum (2023).  Notice that
y[,3:1] compares the third column to the pooled group consisting of columns 1 and 2.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<table role = "presentation">
<tr><td><code>pvals</code></td>
<td>
<p>Upper bounds on the one-sided P-values for the two factors and their combination.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>detail</code></td>
<td>
<p>A matrix with some details of the computations that produced the
P-values.</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>The two P-values from the two factors are combined using the trucated product of P-values due to Zaykin et al. (2002): it is the P-value derived from the product of those P-values that are less
than trunc.  Taking trunc=1 yields Fisher's method for combining independent P-values.  Fisher's method is not ideal when combining P-value bounds produced by sensitivity analyses; see Hsu et al. (2013).  Reasonable values are trunc=.1, truc=.15 and trunc=.2.  As illustrated in the example
below, lower truncation values produce smaller combined P-values when the P-values are
below the truncation point, but a P-value that barely exceeds the truncation point
is effectively discarded.  Hsu et al. (2013) compare truncation values when used in a sensitivity analysis.  For discussion of combining sensitivity analyses as
independent, see the required conditions in Rosenbaum (2011b, 2021).  These conditions
hold for the comparison performed by ef2C.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>The setting alternative = &quot;less&quot; simply replaces y by -y before testing in the
upper tail.

Generalized Sensitivity Analysis for Weighted Rank Statistics in Block Designs
</h2><span id='topic+gwgtRank'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Uses a weighted rank statistic to perform a sensitivity analysis for an I x J observational block design in which each of I blocks contain J individuals, some of whom are treated individuals and others are controls.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>gwgtRank(y, z, phi = "u868", phifunc = NULL, gamma = 1, detail=FALSE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table role = "presentation">
<tr><td><code id="gwgtRank_+3A_y">y</code></td>
<td>

<p>A matrix or data frame of responses with I rows and J columns.  An error will result if y contains NAs.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="gwgtRank_+3A_z">z</code></td>
<td>

<p>A matrix or data frame of treatment indicators with I rows and J columns.  In z, the ith row and jth column is a 1 if this individual is treated, or a 0 if this individual is a control.  If a row of z contains J ones or J zeros, that block will be removed from further computations as there is no one to compare, and a warning will appear.  An error will result if z contains NAs.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="gwgtRank_+3A_phi">phi</code></td>
<td>

<p>The weight function to be applied to the ranks of the within block ranges.  The options are: (i) &quot;wilc&quot; for the stratified Wilcoxon test, which gives every block the same weight, (ii) &quot;quade&quot; which ranks the within block ranges from 1 to I, and is closely related to Quade's (1979) statistic; see also Tardif (1987), (iii) &quot;u868&quot; based on Rosenbaum (2011), (iv) u878 based on Rosenbaum (2011).  Note that phi is ignored if phifunc is not NULL.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="gwgtRank_+3A_phifunc">phifunc</code></td>
<td>
<p> If not NULL, a user specified weight function for the ranks of the within block ranges.  The function should map [0,1] into [0,1].  The function is applied to the ranks divided by the sample size.  See the example.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="gwgtRank_+3A_gamma">gamma</code></td>
<td>

<p>A single number greater than or equal to 1.  gamma is the sensitivity parameter.  Two individuals with the same observed covariates may differ in their odds of treatment by at most a factor of gamma; see Rosenbaum (1987; 2017, Chapter 9).
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="gwgtRank_+3A_detail">detail</code></td>
<td>

<p>If detail=FALSE, then brief output is given, similar to that provided by wgtRank().  In both cases, the asymptotically separable approximation of Gastwirth et al. (2000) is used. If detail=TRUE, then the separable approximation is compared with a bound in Rosenbaum (2018), and the output from the senstrat package is given.  For moderate J and large I, the bound is likely to agree exactly with the separable approximation.
</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The function gwgtRank()
differs from wgtRank() in that wgtRank requires one treated individual and J-1 controls,
whereas gwgtRank permits 1 to J-1 treated indivuals with the rest as controls.
</p>
<p>This function uses the senstrat() function in the senstrat package to perform the calculations.
</p>
<p>To test in the lower tail &ndash; to test against the alternative that treated responses are lower than control responses, apply the function to -y.  For a two-sided test, do both one-sided tests and apply the Bonferroni inequality, doubling the smaller of the two one-sided P-value bounds; see Cox (1977, Section 4.2).
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

the null hypothesis of no treatment effect against the alternative hypothesis that treated responses are higher than control responses.</p>

Root of a Monotone Decreasing Step Function
</h2><span id='topic+stepSolve'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Of limited interest to most users, stepSolve finds a root of a monotone decreasing step function by bisection search.  It is called by other functions in this package,
including wgtRankCI.  If the function f passes but never equals zero, then the argument where f passes zero is returned.  If the function equals zero for an interval, the average of the endpoints of the interval are returned.  The function is used to obtain confidence intervals and point estimates by inverting a rank test, in the spirit of the Hodges-Lehmman estimate.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>stepSolve(f, int, eps = 1e-05)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table role = "presentation">
<tr><td><code id="stepSolve_+3A_f">f</code></td>
<td>

<p>A nonincreasing function of a single argument.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="stepSolve_+3A_int">int</code></td>
<td>

<p>A vector of length 2 with int[1]&lt;int[2].  A search for a root of f will be done on the interval int.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="stepSolve_+3A_eps">eps</code></td>
<td>

<p>A small number.  In searching for a root, a difference of eps will be regarded as negligible.  A larger eps will produce an answer more quickly, while a smaller eps will produce a more accurate answer.
</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Value</h3>

<table role = "presentation">
<tr><td><code>average</code></td>
<td>
<p>The average of low and high, defined below.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>low</code></td>
<td>
<p>See high, defined below.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>high</code></td>
<td>
<p>If the monotone decreasing step function f equals zero for an interval,
then that interval is approximately [low, high].  If f crosses zero but never
equals zero, then the crossing point is between low and high, which should be
close.  Reducing eps will search longer to improve the accuracy of [low, high].</p>

Sensitivity Analysis for Confidence Intervals and Point Estimates from Weighted Rank Statistics in Block Designs
</h2><span id='topic+wgtRankCI'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Uses a weighted rank statistic to perform a sensitivity analysis for an I x J observational block design in which each of I blocks contains one treated individual and J-1 controls.  Inverts the test to obtain an estimate and a confidence interval for an additive treatment effect, tau; see Rosenbaum (1993, 2002, 2007).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>wgtRankCI(y, phi = "u868", phifunc = NULL, gamma = 1,
     alternative="greater", alpha=0.05, eps = 0.00001)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table role = "presentation">
<tr><td><code id="wgtRankCI_+3A_y">y</code></td>
<td>

<p>A matrix or data frame with I rows and J columns.  Column 1 contains the response of the treated individuals and columns 2 throught J contain the responses of controls in the same block.  An error will result if y contains NAs.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="wgtRankCI_+3A_phi">phi</code></td>
<td>

<p>The weight function to be applied to the ranks of the within block ranges.  The options are: (i) &quot;wilc&quot; for the stratified Wilcoxon test, which gives every block the same weight, (ii) &quot;quade&quot; which ranks the within block ranges from 1 to I, and is closely related to Quade's (1979) statistic; see also Tardif (1987), (iii) &quot;u868&quot; based on Rosenbaum (2011), (iv) u878 based on Rosenbaum (2011).  Note that phi is ignored if phifunc is not NULL.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="wgtRankCI_+3A_phifunc">phifunc</code></td>
<td>
<p> If not NULL, a user specified weight function for the ranks of the within block ranges.  The function should map [0,1] into [0,1].  The function is applied to the ranks divided by the sample size.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="wgtRankCI_+3A_gamma">gamma</code></td>
<td>

<p>A single number greater than or equal to 1.  gamma is the sensitivity parameter.  Two individuals with the same observed covariates may differ in their odds of treatment by at most a factor of gamma; see Rosenbaum (2002, Chapter 4; 2017, Chapter 9).
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="wgtRankCI_+3A_alternative">alternative</code></td>
<td>
<p>Must equal &quot;greater&quot;, &quot;less&quot;, or &quot;twosided&quot;.  This determines
whether the confidence interval is one-sided or two-sided.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="wgtRankCI_+3A_alpha">alpha</code></td>
<td>
<p>Coverage of the confidence interval is 1-alpha.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="wgtRankCI_+3A_eps">eps</code></td>
<td>

<p>A small number.  In searching for a root, a difference of eps will be regarded as negligible.  A larger eps will produce an answer more quickly, while a smaller eps will produce a more accurate answer.
</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This test is developed and evaluated in Rosenbaum (2024), and it is inverted for
point estimates and confidence intervals in the usual way.  Understand the test first.
</p>
<p>The two-sided interval is the intersection of two one-sided intervals, each with coverage 1-alpha/2; see Cox (1977, Section 4.2).
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<table role = "presentation">
<tr><td><code>estimate</code></td>
<td>
<p>The interval of point estimates, reducing to a single number when gamma=1.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>confidence</code></td>
<td>
<p>The one-sided or two-sided confidence interval.</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>The computations use the separable approximation discussed in Gastwirth et al. (2000) and Rosenbaum (2018).  Compare with the method in Rosenbaum (2014) and the R package sensitivitymw.

<h3>Note</h3>

<p>For discussion of testing twice in matched pairs, see Rosenbaum (2012).
</p>
<p>Testing twice is also possible in block designs using weighted rank statistics because the same value of the unobserved covariate provides the upper bound for both statistics when using the separable approximation in Gastwirth et al. (2000) and Rosenbaum (2018, Remarks 4 and 5).  See also Rosenbaum (2022) where the Bahadur efficiency of such tests is computed.
</p>
<p>Other packages that use testing twice in a different way are &quot;sensitivity2x2xk&quot;&quot; and &quot;testtwice&quot;.  The &quot;testtwice&quot; package is restricted to matched pairs, and &quot;sensitivity2x2xk&quot;&quot; is for binary outcomes.  With some attention to detail (e.g., the handling of zero pair differences), in the case of matched pairs, the &quot;testtwice&quot; package and the wgtRanktt() function will yield identical results.  In that sense, wgtRanktt() extends the method to blocks designs.
</p>
<p>Testing twice achieves the larger Bahadur efficiency of the two component statistics; see Berk and Jones (1978).
