Catalogues of resolution IV 128 run 2-level fractional factorials up to 33 factors 
that do have 5-letter words
</h2><span id='topic+FrF2.catlg128-package'></span><span id='topic+FrF2.catlg128'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Description: This package provides the complete catalogues of those resolution IV 
regular fractional factorial designs in 128 runs for up to 33 2-level factors that 
do have length 5 words (i.e. are not even). For 8 to 11 factors, the best design 
(resolution higher than IV, i.e. all two-factor interactions are clear) is included 
only.</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The complete set of designs on which these catalogues are based 
has been provided by Xu (2009) for up to 25 factors and by Mee (2012) for 26 to 33 factors. 
The designs provided in this package are useful for special tasks to 
be accomplished with package <span class="pkg"><a href="FrF2.html#topic+FrF2-package">FrF2</a></span>. The catalogues 
are separately provided here, because they are very large 
and should not be forced upon <span class="pkg">FrF2</span> users 
who do not need them. 
</p>
<p>The main reason for providing the catalogues is to support estimability requirements 
for clear two-factor interactions in package <span class="pkg">FrF2</span>. According to 
Wu, Mee and Tang (2012), resolution IV designs with no 5-letter words do not add 
value (there is always a better design that can accomodate the same clear two-factor interactions).
Therefore, starting with version 1.1, resolution IV designs without 5-letter words have been omitted 
from the catalogues, and the title of the package has been changed accordingly, 
from the previous &quot;Complete catalogues of resolution IV 128 run 
2-level fractional factorials up to 24 factors&quot;. The previously available complete catalogues 
of designs can be downloaded from the author's website.
Designs for 25 to 33 factors have been added with version 1.2 of the package.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The files contain catalogues for regular fractional factorial designs in 128 runs; 
the numbers after the period indicate the number(s) of factors covered by the 
respective catalogue. All the catalogues are lists of class <code><a href="FrF2.html#topic+catlg">catlg</a></code>. 
They are provided in support of package <span class="pkg"><a href="FrF2.html#topic+FrF2-package">FrF2</a></span>. <br />
</p>
<p>Originally, their main intention was to support automatic search of clear designs with 
options <code>estimable</code> and <code>clear=TRUE</code> in function <code><a href="FrF2.html#topic+FrF2">FrF2</a></code>. 
For this purpose, in principle, a complete catalogue of resolution IV designs in 128 runs 
would be needed. The catalogues come from Xu (2009; supplement on his website up to 25 factors) 
or Mee (2012, personal communication) 
and have been enriched by information on clear interactions 
(entry <code>clear.2fis</code> for each element). 
</p>
<p>Since version 2 of package <span class="pkg">FrF2</span>, the catalogues can also support 
blocking of designs by the method proposed by Godolphin (2020), 
automated as described in Groemping (2021); with this method, blocking can (but need not) 
be combined with requiring specific 2fis to be clear. 
A few catalogue elements that are useful for that method have been added to 
the catalogue <code>catlg</code> in package <span class="pkg">FrF2</span>. If a desired blocked design cannot 
be obtained in adequate quality by using entries from <code>catlg</code> or from the suitable 
catalogue from this package, one may have to resort to the larger catalogues that 
are available from the author's website (see also next paragraph).
</p>
<p>For the search of clear designs, 
Wu, Mee and Tang (2012) proved that one need not consider designs with 
no 5-letter words, as they are always dominated by a better design that can 
clearly accomodate the same two-factor interactions. Therefore, as of version 1.1 
of this package, the resolution IV designs in the catalogues have been reduced to 
those that do have 5-letter words. For the search for clear designs, it even suffices 
to search dominating designs only. These are identified by the dominating element 
of each catalogue entry. 
The previous complete catalogues of designs 
can be downloaded from the author's website. Catalogues 
for 25 to 33 factors have been made available with version 1.2 of the package. 
</p>
<p>If one of these catalogues is used in the <code>select.catlg</code> option of 
function <code><a href="FrF2.html#topic+FrF2">FrF2</a></code>, the function is guaranteed to find the 
best clear design in 128 runs for the requested number of factors, 
when used with its option <code>estimable</code>.
</p>
<p>For earlier versions of the package, the catalogues had to be loaded with 
a <code>data()</code> command. This is no longer required, and not even supported; 
the catalogues will now be automatically loaded on first use.
