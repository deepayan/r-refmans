<h2 id='bytescircle'>Statistics About Bytes Contained in a File as a Circle Plot</h2><span id='topic+bytescircle'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>bytescircle is a function that shows statistics about bytes contained in a file
as a circle graph of deviations from mean in sigma increments.
Histogram and boxplot graphs can also be generated.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>bytescircle(
  FILE = "",
  ascii = FALSE,
  plot = 1,
  col = c(),
  output = 1,
  input = NULL,
  restrict = FALSE
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr><td><code id="bytescircle_+3A_file">FILE</code></td>
<td>
<p>char array with the path to an existing file to analyse</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="bytescircle_+3A_ascii">ascii</code></td>
<td>
<p>boolean, if TRUE R will output an ascii circle char of deviations
from sigma (true sd). Each ascii char represents a different deviation from
sigma. The array of chars used (from -9/4 to +9/4 sigma, in increments
of 0.5 sigma) can be printed using parameter 'output=2'</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="bytescircle_+3A_plot">plot</code></td>
<td>
<p>number from 0 to 5, indicates plot to represent:
</p>
<p>0: no plot
</p>
<p>1: circle of bytes: using an archimedean spiral each byte value is represented
with a coloured circle which size indicates the amount of deviation from
sigma. A green colour indicates positive sigma value whilst red indicates
a negative sigma value. Blue little circles represents byte values that do
not appear in the file
</p>
<p>2: circle of bytes with indication of the byte bucket represented
</p>
<p>3: graph of byte counts: in green values over mean, in red values below it.
Also the lines for +/- sd over mean (black dotted line), IQR (Interquartile
Range) (dotted green line), and boxplot's binf and bsup values (dotted blue)
values are represented as horizontal lines
</p>
<p>4: bar graph of byte counts
</p>
<p>5: boxplot() graph of byte's data
</p>
<p>Note that ascii parameter's value is independent of the value of 'plot'</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="bytescircle_+3A_col">col</code></td>
<td>
<p>vector of color values, colours can be indicated as a vector of
colours from 1 to 3 elements, which will be used differently depending on the
plot selected. By default, the first colour of the vector will replace the
default green, the second the default red, and the third the default blue.
Not all colours are used on every plot.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="bytescircle_+3A_output">output</code></td>
<td>
<p>integer (0, 1, 2), as function outputs data (file, mean, sd,
CV, file size) on R console after every call, this output can be turned
off using 'output=0'. A value of 2 will output the char array used for ascii
graph output.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="bytescircle_+3A_input">input</code></td>
<td>
<p>factor or vector, the function can accept its own output as input.
This can be useful for generating a new graph without the hassle of R reading
and analysing the file again. The input can also be a bare 256 element vector:
in this case each element represents the appeareances in the file of that
[n-1] byte value.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="bytescircle_+3A_restrict">restrict</code></td>
<td>
<p>boolean, if TRUE statistics will use only the number of byte values
(buckets) that appear in the file, and not the 256 default value. This makes
a difference only if there're byte values that do not appear in the file.</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The function can be useful for statistically analyze the content of files
in a glimpse: text files are shown as a green centered crown, compressed
and encrypted files should be shown as equally distributed variations with
a very low CV (sigma/mean), and other types of files can be classified between
these two categories depending on their text vs binary content, which can be
useful to quickly determine how information is stored inside them (databases,
multimedia files, etc).
</p>
<p>bytescircle() accepts a character string as path for the file, though if
it is not indicated, a file selection GUI will demand it.
The 'ascii=TRUE' param replicates the linux behaviour of bytes-circle command
with params '-o 1', or equivalently '-b', as RStudio or R output do not have
colour output.
</p>
<p>bytescircle() outputs data (file, mean, sd, CV, file size) on R console, but
this can be turned off using 'output=0'. A value of 2 will output the char
array used for ascii graph output.
</p>
<p>'plot' param accepts a number from 0 (no plot) to 5 (boxplot)
</p>
<p>Colours can be indicated as a vector of colours from 1 to 3 elements, which
will be used differently depending on the plot selected. By default, the
first colour of the vector will replace the default green, the second the
default red, and the third the default blue. Not all colours are used on
every plot.
</p>
<p>bytescircle() can accept its own output as input using 'input=variable'.
This can be useful for generating a new graph without the hassle of R reading
and analysing the file again. The input can also be a bare 256 element vector:
in this case each element represents the appeareances in the file of that
[n-1] byte value.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>factor of values :
</p>
<p>$bytes: vector of 256 elements, counts of each byte value in the file
</p>
<p>$deviation: vector of 256 elements, (count-mean)/sigma for each byte value in the file
</p>
<p>$file: char array, input file analysed. If input were a variable, it is &quot;R input&quot;
</p>
<p>$mean: mean value
</p>
<p>$sd: sigma (true sd) value: sigma=sd()*sqrt((n-1)/n)
</p>
<p>$cv: coefficient of variation (mean/sigma*100)
</p>
<p>$circle: complex matrix representing an ascii circle: each element is the
deviation from sigma of the represented byte. Elements which do not
represent bytes get the value '0+1i'. See bytescircle's User Manual (R vignette).

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'> bytescircle( system.file("extdata", "gplv3.txt", package="bytescircle"),
   ascii=TRUE, plot=1, output=2)

 # which bytes in this file have a sd greater than 2*sigma?
 BYTES=bytescircle( system.file("extdata", "gplv3.txt.gz", package="bytescircle"), plot=3,
   col=c("gold","blueviolet"));
 which(BYTES$deviation&gt;2.0)-1 # -1, 'cause BYTES[1] corresponds to byte 0

 # use a vector as input:
 BYTES=c(256:1); bytescircle(input=BYTES,output=0)
