Penalty Shots in the German Men's Bundesliga (Association Football)
</h2><span id='topic+penalties'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This data set contains information on all penalty shot's taken in the German Men's Bundesliga from its inaugural season
1963/64 until the end of season 2016/17. 
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>data("penalties")</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 4599 observations on the following 15 variables.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>date</code></dt><dd><p>Date vector containing the date the penalty was taken.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>season</code></dt><dd><p>Character vector containing the season the penalty was taken in.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>matchday</code></dt><dd><p>Numeric vector that specifies the match day the penalty was taken on. Usually, seasons in
the men\'s bundesliga consist of 34 match days, but there have been some seasons with a varying number, 30 and 38.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>goalkeeper</code></dt><dd><p>Character vector containing the name of the goalkeeper the penalty was taken against.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>penaltytaker</code></dt><dd><p>Character vector containing the name of the player who took the penalty.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>homegame</code></dt><dd><p>Numeric vector that specifies where the match was played, 1 indicates an away match for the
goalkeeper, 2 a home match. In many cases it is advisable to convert this variable to a factor.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>result</code></dt><dd><p>Character vector that gives the result of the penalty in German. Possible values are
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>Tor</code>: Goal
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>gehalten</code>: Save (abbreviation for gehalten)
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>vorbei</code>: Miss (abbreviation for vorbei)
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>drüber</code>: Miss, too high (abbreviation for drüber)
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>Latte</code>: Miss, hit the crossbar (abbreviation for Latte)
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>Pfosten</code>: Miss, hit the post (abbreviation for Pfosten)</p>
</li></ul>

<p>The difference between a save and a miss is that the goalkeeper actively stopped the ball for save, whereas
the penalty taker missed the goal without the goalkeeper touching it in the latter case.
</p>
<p>The distinction between different types of misses is included for historical reasons only. Current policy is to
distinguish between goals, saves, and misses only. Analyses that rely on <code>drüb</code>, <code>Latt</code> or <code>Pfos</code>
are likely misleading.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>minute</code></dt><dd><p>Numeric vector specifying the minute of the match the penalty was taken in.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>goaldiff</code></dt><dd><p>Numeric vector that gives the goal difference before the penalty was taken. A positive number
indicates that the goalkeeper's club is in the lead.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>gkclub</code></dt><dd><p>Character vector that specifies the goalkeeper's club</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>ptclub</code></dt><dd><p>Character vector that specifies the penalty taker's club</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>gkage</code></dt><dd><p>Numeric vector giving the goalkeeper's age in years at the time the penalty was given</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>ptage</code></dt><dd><p>Numeric vector giving the penalty taker's age in years at the time the penalty was given</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>gkexp</code></dt><dd><p>Numeric vector giving the goalkeeper's experience, measured in number of seasons.
0 stands for the debut season, from then on, 1 is added for every following season,
regardless of whether the player played in the Bundesliga or not.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>ptexp</code></dt><dd><p>Numeric vector giving the penalty taker's experience, measured in number of seasons.
0 stands for the debut season, from then on, 1 is added for every following season,
regardless of whether the player played in the Bundesliga or not.</p>
</dd>

<h2 id='penaltyPlot'>
Plot an overview of all penalties taken by or against a men's Bundesliga player.
</h2><span id='topic+penaltyPlot'></span>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Search for a player &ndash; either exact match or using fixed regular expressions &ndash; and
create a plot of all penalties taken by or against this player as table with the date
on the x-axis and the result on the y-axis.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>penaltyPlot(player, goalkeeper = TRUE, exact = TRUE, pendat, includeMisses = TRUE,
  quarterlyAxis = TRUE, colours = NULL, main = NULL, sub = NULL, jitter = TRUE,
  yvalconst = FALSE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr><td><code id="penaltyPlot_+3A_player">player</code></td>
<td>

<p>Character vector of length 1 which contains the full name of a player in <code>pendat</code>
or a part thereof.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="penaltyPlot_+3A_goalkeeper">goalkeeper</code></td>
<td>

<p>Boolean, specifies whether <code>player</code> is searched for among goalkeepers (TRUE)
or penalty takers (FALSE).
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="penaltyPlot_+3A_exact">exact</code></td>
<td>

<p>Boolean, specifies whether to look for an exact match. If set to FALSE,
<code>grep(player, fixed = TRUE)</code> is used to search for the player.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="penaltyPlot_+3A_pendat">pendat</code></td>
<td>

<p>Name of a data set containing the penalties. The data set needs to follow the
format of <code><a href="#topic+penalties">penalties</a></code>.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="penaltyPlot_+3A_includemisses">includeMisses</code></td>
<td>

<p>Boolean, indicates whether to include penalties that missed the goal without the
goalkeeper actively saving the ball.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="penaltyPlot_+3A_quarterlyaxis">quarterlyAxis</code></td>
<td>

<p>Boolean, to customise the x-axis. If TRUE, the beginning of every quarter of each year
will be included on the axis, if FALSE, only the beginning of each year will be marked.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="penaltyPlot_+3A_colours">colours</code></td>
<td>

<p>Vector of length 3 that indicate the colours for saves, misses, and goals. The default
value tries to reflect the relative success of each outcome for goalkeepers and penalty takers.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="penaltyPlot_+3A_main">main</code></td>
<td>

<p>Main title of the plot. The default indicates who the penalties were taken by or against.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="penaltyPlot_+3A_sub">sub</code></td>
<td>

<p>Subtitle of the plot. The defaults indicates whether missed shots were included or not.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="penaltyPlot_+3A_jitter">jitter</code></td>
<td>

<p>Boolean, should observations be jittered along the y-axis to avoid overlap?
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="penaltyPlot_+3A_yvalconst">yvalconst</code></td>
<td>

<p>Boolean, if TRUE, all penalties are plotted with a constant y-value (jitter may be added
afterwards if <code>jitter = TRUE</code>). If FALSE, saves, misses, and goals are plotted with
three different y-values (plus possible jitter). A legend is added to the top of the plot
in that case.
</p>
