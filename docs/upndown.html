<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Historically, most up-and-down studies have used dose-averaging estimates. Many of them focus on reversal points either as anchor/cutoff points &ndash; points where the averaging begins &ndash; or as the <strong>only</strong> doses to use in the estimate.  Excluding doses before the anchor/cutoff is done in order to mitigate the bias due to the arbitrary location of the starting dose. The extent of excluded sample depends on the distance between the starting dose and the
up-and-down balance point, as well as the random-walk vagaries of an individual experimental run.
</p>
<p>Oron (2007) showed that using only reversals and skipping other doses is generally a bad idea, and also noted that a reversal anchor point is not directly tied to the conceptual motivation for having an anchor/cutoff point.
</p>
<p>In practice, some <em>&quot;lucky&quot;</em> experiments might not need any exclusion at all (because they started right at the balance point), while others might need to exclude dozens of observations. Reversals do not capture this variability well.
</p>
<p>The estimation method coded in <code>adaptmean()</code> works from a different principle. It identifies <strong>the first crossing point:</strong> the first point at which
the dose is <em>&quot;on the other side&quot;</em> from the starting point, compared with the average of all remaining doses.
The average of all remaining doses is used as a proxy to the (unobservable) balance point.
This approach is far closer to capturing the dynamics described above, and indeed performs well
in comparative simulations (Oron et al. 2022, Supplement).
</p>
<p>Interestingly, unlike other methods <code>adaptmean()</code> does not require the experiment's binary responses as input; only the dose-allocation sequence.
</p>
<p>The reason <code>adaptmean()</code> has not been further developed nor published, is that like all dose-averaging estimators,
at present there doesn't seem to be a reliable confidence interval to accompany any of them.
</p>
<p>For UDD target estimation we recommend using centered isotonic regression, a more robust method available
together with a confidence interval via <code><a href="#topic+udest">udest</a></code>, an up-and-down adapted wrapper to <code>cir::quickInverse()</code>.
See Oron et al. 2022 (both article and supplement) for further information, as well as the <code>cir</code> package vignette.

par(mar=c(4,4,4,1), mgp=c(2.5,0.8,0), cex.axis = 0.7, las = 1)
udplot(doses, responses, main='Van Elstraete et al. 2008 Study', 
       xtitle = "Patient Number", ytitle = 'Gabapentin (mg/kg)') 


#' Overlay the ED50 reported in the article (21.7 mg/kg):
abline(h = 21.7)

#' The authors cite a little-known 1991 article by Dixon as the method source.
#' However, in their author rejoinder they claim to have used the Dixon-Mood (1948) estimate.


# Our package does include the Dixon-Mood point estimate.
#  (w/o the CIs, because we do not endorse this estimation approach)
# Does it reproduce the article estimate?
dixonmood(doses, responses)

# Not at all! Let us overlay this one in red
abline(h = dixonmood(doses, responses), col=2)

# We have found that many articles claiming to use Dixon-Mood (or Dixon-Massey) actually
# Do something else. For example, in this article they report that 
#   "it is necessary to reject sequences with three to six identical results".
# Nothing like this appears in the original Dixon-Mood article, where the estimation method
#   involves identifying the less-common response (either 0 or 1), and using only x values
#   associated with these responses; obviating the need to exclude specific sequences.
#
# More generally, these historical estimates have long passed their expiry dates. 
#   Their foundation is not nearly as solid as, e.g., linear regression, 
#      and it's time to stop using them.

# That said, our package does offer two more types of dose-averaging estimates.
# Both are able to take advantage of the "n+1" dose-allocation, which is determined by
#    the last dose and response:
n = length(doses)
dosePlus1 = doses[n] + ifelse(responses[n]==0, 1, -1)
reversmean(c(doses, dosePlus1), responses)
# Interestingly, in this particular case the answer is very similar to the Dixon-Mood estimate.

# The `reversmean()` default averages all doses from the 3rd reversal point onwards.
# By the way, at what point did the third reversal happen? 
#     It'll be the 3rd number in this vector:
reversals(responses)

# Far more commonly in literature, particularly in sensory studies, 
#   one encounters the 1960s-era approach (led by Wetherill) of taking *only doses  
#   at reversal points, usually starting from the first one. `reversmean()` can do that too:
wetherill = reversmean(c(doses, dosePlus1), responses, all = FALSE, rstart = 1)
wetherill
# This one gives an even lower result than the previous ones.
abline(h = wetherill, col = 3)

# There's another approach to dose-averaging, although it is not in use anywhere that we know of.
# It does not require the y values at all. The underlying assumption is that the dose 
#   sequence has done enough meandering around the true balance point, to provide information
#   about where (approximately) the starting-dose effect is neutralized.
adaptmean(c(doses, dosePlus1))
# Again a bit curiously, this relatively recent approach gives a result similar to what
#   the authors reported (but not similar to the original Dixon-Mood).
# This is not too surprising, since here `adaptmean()` excludes the first one-third of doses,
#   which is approximately what happened if indeed the authors excluded all those long dose-increase
#   sequences at the start.

# All this shows how dicey dose-averaging, at face value a simple and effective method, can become.
# The sample size here is rather large for up-and-down studies, and yet because of the unlucky
#    choice of starting point (which in many studies, due to safety concerns cannot be evaded)
#    there is really no good option of which observations to exclude.

# This is one reason why we strongly recommend using Centered Isotonic Regression as default:
defest = udest(doses, responses, target = 0.5)
abline(h = defest$point, col = 'purple')
# For this dataset, it is the highest of all the estimates.

legend('bottomright', col = c(1:3, 'purple'), 
       legend = c("Article's estimate", 'Dixon-Mood', 'Reversals (Wetherill)', 'Standard (CIR)'),

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Up-and-Down designs (UDDs) generate random walk behavior, whose theoretical properties can be summarized via a transition probability matrix (TPM). Given the number of doses <code class="reqn">M</code>, and the value of the cdf <code class="reqn">F</code> at each dose (i.e., the positive-response probabilities), the specific UDD rules uniquely determine the TPM.
</p>
<p>The utilities described here calculate the TPMs of the most common and simplest UDDs:
</p>

<ul>
<li><p> The k-in-a-row or <strong>fixed staircase</strong> design common in sensory studies: <code style="white-space: pre;">&#8288;kmatMarg(), kmatFull()&#8288;</code> (Gezmu, 1996; Oron and Hoff, 2009; see Note). Design parameters are k, a natural number, and whether k negative responses are required for dose transition, or k positive responses. The former is for targets below the median and vice versa.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The Durham-Flournoy Biased Coin Design: <code>bcdmat()</code>. This design can target any percentile via the <code>target</code> argument (Durham and Flournoy, 1994).
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The original <em>&quot;classical&quot;</em> median-targeting UDD: <code>classicmat()</code> (Dixon and Mood, 1948). This is simply a wrapper for <code>bcdmat()</code> with <code>target</code> set to 0.5.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Cohort or group UDD: <code>gudmat()</code>, with three design parameters for the group size and the up/down rule thresholds  (Gezmu and Flournoy, 2006).
</p>
</li></ul>



<h3>Value</h3>

<p>An <code class="reqn">M\times M</code> transition probability matrix, except for <code>kmatFull()</code> with <code class="reqn">k&gt;1</code> which returns a larger square matrix.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>As Gezmu (1996) discovered and Oron and Hoff (2009) further extended, k-in-a-row UDDs with <code class="reqn">k&gt;1</code> generate a random walk <em>with internal states</em>. Their full TPM is therefore larger than <code class="reqn">M\times M.</code> However, in terms of random-walk behavior, most salient properties are better represented via an <code class="reqn">M\times M</code> matrix analogous to those of the other designs, with transition probabilities marginalized over internal states using their asymptotic frequencies. This matrix is provided by <code>kmatMarg()</code>, while <code>kmatFull()</code> returns the full matrix including internal states.
</p>
<p>Also, in <code>kmatFull()</code> there are two matrix-size options. Near one of the boundaries (upper boundary with <code>lowTarget = TRUE</code>, and vice versa), the most extreme <code class="reqn">k</code> internal states are practically indistinguishable, so in some sense only one of them really exists. Using the <code>fluffup</code> argument, users can choose between having a more aesthetically symmetric (but a bit misleading) full <code class="reqn">Mk\times Mk</code> matrix, or reducing it to its effectivelly true size by removing <code class="reqn">k-1</code> rows and columns.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>In their documentation of the Up-and-Down algorithm, Dixon and Mood (1948) presented an estimation method based on tallying and averaging responses, choosing to use only the positive or negative responses (the less-common of the two), since they reasoned the two mirror each other. This is not strictly true: it ignores both leading/trailing &quot;tail&quot; sequences of identical responses, and repeated visits to the boundary dose in case there are dose boundaries.
</p>
<p>The Dixon-Mood estimate (sometimes called Dixon-Massey) is provided here mostly for historical reasons and comparative-simulation uses, and also because this estimate is apparently <em>(and unfortunately)</em> still in use in some fields. <strong>It should not be used for actual target-dose estimation in real experiments.</strong> It behaves very poorly even under minor deviations from the most optimal conditions (see, e.g., simulations in the supplement to Oron et al. 2022.).
</p>
<p>In order to discourage from actual use in experiments, we do not provide a method for the Dixon-Mood estimator's confidence interval, even though the original article did include one. The interval estimate behaves even more poorly than the point estimate.
</p>
<p>For UDD target estimation we recommend using centered isotonic regression, available via <code><a href="#topic+udest">udest</a></code>, an up-and-down adapted wrapper to <code>cir::quickInverse()</code>. See Oron et al. 2022 (both article and supplement) for further information, as well as the <code>cir</code> package vignette.

udplot(doses, responses, main='Van Elstraete et al. 2008 Study', 
       xtitle = "Patient Number", ytitle = 'Gabapentin (mg/kg)') 


#' Overlay the ED50 reported in the article (21.7 mg/kg):
abline(h = 21.7)

#' The authors cite a little-known 1991 article by Dixon as the method source.
#' However, in their author rejoinder they claim to have used the Dixon-Mood (1948) estimate.


# Our package does include the Dixon-Mood point estimate.
#  (w/o the CIs, because we do not endorse this estimation approach)
# Does it reproduce the article estimate?
dixonmood(doses, responses)

# Not at all! Let us overlay this one in red
abline(h = dixonmood(doses, responses), col=2)

# We have found that many articles claiming to use Dixon-Mood (or Dixon-Massey) actually
# Do something else. For example, in this article they report that 
#   "it is necessary to reject sequences with three to six identical results".
# Nothing like this appears in the original Dixon-Mood article, where the estimation method
#   involves identifying the less-common response (either 0 or 1), and using only x values
#   associated with these responses; obviating the need to exclude specific sequences.
#
# More generally, these historical estimates have long passed their expiry dates. 
#   Their foundation is not nearly as solid as, e.g., linear regression, 
#      and it's time to stop using them.

# That said, our package does offer two more types of dose-averaging estimates.
# Both are able to take advantage of the "n+1" dose-allocation, which is determined by
#    the last dose and response:
n = length(doses)
dosePlus1 = doses[n] + ifelse(responses[n]==0, 1, -1)
reversmean(c(doses, dosePlus1), responses)
# Interestingly, in this particular case the answer is very similar to the Dixon-Mood estimate.

# The `reversmean()` default averages all doses from the 3rd reversal point onwards.
# By the way, at what point did the third reversal happen? 
#     It'll be the 3rd number in this vector:
reversals(responses)

# Far more commonly in literature, particularly in sensory studies, 
#   one encounters the 1960s-era approach (led by Wetherill) of taking *only doses  
#   at reversal points, usually starting from the first one. `reversmean()` can do that too:
wetherill = reversmean(c(doses, dosePlus1), responses, all = FALSE, rstart = 1)
wetherill
# This one gives an even lower result than the previous ones.
abline(h = wetherill, col = 3)

# There's another approach to dose-averaging, although it is not in use anywhere that we know of.
# It does not require the y values at all. The underlying assumption is that the dose 
#   sequence has done enough meandering around the true balance point, to provide information
#   about where (approximately) the starting-dose effect is neutralized.
adaptmean(c(doses, dosePlus1))
# Again a bit curiously, this relatively recent approach gives a result similar to what
#   the authors reported (but not similar to the original Dixon-Mood).
# This is not too surprising, since here `adaptmean()` excludes the first one-third of doses,
#   which is approximately what happened if indeed the authors excluded all those long dose-increase
#   sequences at the start.

# All this shows how dicey dose-averaging, at face value a simple and effective method, can become.
# The sample size here is rather large for up-and-down studies, and yet because of the unlucky
#    choice of starting point (which in many studies, due to safety concerns cannot be evaded)
#    there is really no good option of which observations to exclude.

# This is one reason why we strongly recommend using Centered Isotonic Regression as default:
defest = udest(doses, responses, target = 0.5)
abline(h = defest$point, col = 'purple')
# For this dataset, it is the highest of all the estimates.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>After an up-and-down experiment, it is highly recommended to plot not just the experiment's <em>&quot;trace&quot;</em>  time-series (<code><a href="#topic+udplot">udplot</a></code>), but also the dose-response summaries. This utility provides a convenient interface for doing that.
</p>

<ul>
<li><p> It summarizes the response rates at each participating dose, and plots them. At default, symbol area is proportional to the number of observations at each dose.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Optionally, the centered-isotonic-regression (CIR) target-dose estimate and its confidence interval are also calculated and plotted.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> A further option allows for plotting the entire estimated CIR dose-response curve.
</p>
</li></ul>

<p><code>drplot()</code> is a convenience wrapper to <code>cir::plot.doseResponse</code>, with the added option of plotting the estimate. Some specific options, such as disabling the proportional-area symbol plotting, are accessible only via <code>plot.doseResponse</code> arguments (specified in your <code>drplot()</code> call and passed through the <code>...</code>).
</p>
<p>This is a base-R plot, so you can use additional options, including preceding the plot command with <code><a href="graphics.html#topic+par">par</a></code> statements, or following up with <code><a href="graphics.html#topic+legend">legend</a></code>. When wishing to save to a file, I recommend utilities such as <code>png()</code> or <code>pdf()</code>.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Returns invisibly after plotting. If you would like to save the plot to a file, embed the plotting code in a standard R graphics export code sequence, (e.g., <code>pdf(...)</code> before the plotting function, and <code>dev.off()</code> after it).

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This suite of utilities helps users
</p>

<ul>
<li><p> Figure out the approximate target response-rate (a.k.a. the <em>balance point</em>), given design parameters;
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Suggest potential design parameters, given user's desired target response-rate and other constraints.
</p>
</li></ul>

<p>Up-and-down designs (UDDs) generate random walks over dose space, with most dose-allocations usually taking place near the design's de-facto target percentile, called the <strong>&quot;balance point&quot;</strong> by some theorists to distinguish it from the user-designated target in case they differ (Oron and Hoff 2009, Oron et al. 2022).
</p>
<p>Most k-in-a-row and group UDD parameter combinations yield balance points that are irrational percentiles of the dose-response function, and therefore are unappealing as official experimental targets.
</p>
<p>However, since the UD dose distribution has some width, and since even the balance point itself is only a close approximation for the actual average of allocated doses, the user's target <strong>does not have to be identical to the balance point.</strong> It only needs to be <em>&quot;close enough&quot;</em>.
</p>
<p>The <code>k2targ()</code> and <code>g2targ()</code> utilities are intended for users who already have a specific k-in-a-row or group design in mind, and only want to verify its balance point. The complementary utilities <code style="white-space: pre;">&#8288;ktargOptions(), gtargOptions()&#8288;</code> provide a broader survey of design-parameter options within user-specified constraints, given a desired target.
</p>
<p>Lastly, <code>bcoin()</code> returns the biased-coin probabilities given the user's designated target. In contrast to the two other UDDs described above, the biased-coin design can target any percentile with a precisely matched balance point. That said, k-in-a-row and group UDDs offer some advantages over biased-coin in terms of properties and operational simplicity.
</p>
<p><code>bcoin()</code> can return the probability as a decimal (default) or approximate rational fraction. In the latter case, if <code>nameplate</code> is set to <code>TRUE</code>, you will get the exact <em>&quot;nameplate&quot;</em> coin probability <code class="reqn">\Gamma/(1 - \Gamma)</code>, with <code class="reqn">\Gamma</code> being the target percentile between 0 and 1. However, the default <code>nameplate = FALSE</code> might nudge the coin to yield a balance point somewhat closer to the median. This choice is based upon the theoretical finding that the biased-coin design does tend to concentrate doses a bit further away from the median than the balance point would suggest (Oron and Hoff, 2009). See more information in <code>bcoin()</code>'s argument descriptions.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>


<ul>
<li> <p><code style="white-space: pre;">&#8288;k2targ(), g2targ()&#8288;</code>: the official balance point given the user-provided design parameters.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code style="white-space: pre;">&#8288;ktargOptions(), gtargOptions()&#8288;</code>: a <code>data.frame</code> with design parameters and official balance point, for all options that meet user-provided constraints. A printed string provides dose transition rule guidance.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code style="white-space: pre;">&#8288;bcoin():&#8288;</code> a printed string that informs user of the biased-coin design rules, including the 'coin' probability in its user-chosen format (decimal or fraction). In case the user-desired target is 0.5 or very close to it, the string will inform user that they are better off just using classical UDD without a coin.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Up-and-Down designs (UDDs) generate random walk behavior, which concentrates doses around the target quantile. Asymptotically, dose allocations follow a stationary distribution <code class="reqn">\boldsymbol{\pi}</code> which can be calculated given the number of doses <code class="reqn">M</code>, and the value of the cdf <code class="reqn">F</code> at each dose (i.e., the positive-response probabilities), and the specific UDD rules. No matter the starting dose, the allocation distribution converges to <code class="reqn">\boldsymbol{\pi}</code> at a geometric rate (Diaconis and Stroock, 1991).
</p>
<p>Three functions are offered:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>pivec()</code> returns <code class="reqn">\boldsymbol{\pi}</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>currentvec()</code> returns the current (instantaneous) allocation distribution at step <code>n</code>, using the formula from Diaconis and Stroock (1991).
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>cumulvec()</code> returns the <em>cumulative</em> allocations, i.e., the expected proportions (or counts) of allocations during the experiment after <code>n</code> observations. This function is perhaps of greatest practical use.
</p>
</li></ul>

<p>All functions first calculate the transition probability matrix (TPM), by calling one of the functions described under <code><a href="#topic+bcdmat">bcdmat</a></code>. See that help page for more details.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A vector of allocation frequencies/probabilities for the doses, summing up to 1. Exception: <code>cumulvec(propotions = FALSE)</code> returns a vector of expected allocation counts, summing up to <code>n - exclude</code>.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>When using the k-in-a-row design, set <code>matfun = kmatMarg</code>, not <code>kmatFull</code>.

<pre><code class='language-R'>#----- Classical UD Example -----#

# An example used in Oron et al. 2022, Fig. 2.
# It is presented here via the original motivating story:
# "Ketofol"  is a commonly-used anesthesia-inducing mix known to combine its 2 components' 
# beneficial properties, while each component mitigates the other's harmful side-effects. 
# In particular:
#     Propofol reduces blood pressure while ketamine raises it.
# What is *not* known at present, is which mix proportions produce 
# 0 "delta-BP" on average among the population. 

# The classical UD design below administers the mix 0-100% ketamine in 10% increments.
#    The design will concentrate doses around the point where half the population 
#    experiences 0 "delta-BP". (the 'zeroPt' parameter in the code)

doses = seq(0, 100, 10)
m=length(doses) # 11 dose levels

zeroPt=63 # the zero-BP point, in units of percent ketamine

# We assume a Normal ("Probit") dose-response curve,
#   and calculate the value of F (i.e.,  prob (delta BP &gt; 0) at the doses:
equivF = pnorm( (doses - zeroPt) / 20)
round(equivF, 3)

# The vector below represents the values feeding into the Fig. 2B barplot.
# "startdose = 6" means the experiment begins from the 6th out of 11 doses, i.e., a 50:50 mix.


  round(cumulvec(cdf = equivF, matfun = classicmat, startdose = 6, n = 30), 3)

# Compare with the *instantaneous* probability distribution to the 30th patient:

round(currentvec(cdf = equivF, matfun = classicmat, startdose = 6, n = 30), 3)
# Classic up-and-down has quasi-periodic behavior with a (quasi-)period of 2. 
# Compare the instantaneous vectors at n=30 and 29:
round(currentvec(cdf = equivF, matfun = classicmat, startdose = 6, n = 29), 3)
# Note the alternating near-zero values. Distributions at even/odd n "communicate"
#    with each other only via the dose boundaries.

# Lastly, the asymptotic/stationary distribution. Notice there is no 'n' argument.

round(pivec(cdf = equivF, matfun = classicmat), 3)

# The cumulative vector at n=30 is not very far from the asymptotic vector. 
# The main difference is that at n=30 there's still a bit more
#    probability weight at the starting dose.
# We can check how much of that extra weight is from the 1st patient, by excluding that data point:

round(cumulvec(cdf = equivF, matfun = classicmat, startdose = 6, n = 30, exclude = 1), 3)

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Up-and-Down designs (UDDs) allocate doses in a random walk centered nearly symmetrically around a balance point. Therefore, a modified average of allocated doses could be a plausible estimate of the balance point's location.
</p>
<p>During UDDs' first generation, a variety of dose-averaging estimators was developed, with the one proposed by Wetherill et al. (1966) eventually becoming the most popular. This estimator uses only doses observed at <em>reversal</em> points: points with a negative response following a positive one, or vice versa. More recent research (Kershaw 1985, 1987; Oron et al. 2022, supplement) strongly indicates that in fact it is better to use all doses starting from some cut-point, rather than skip most of them and choose only reversals.
</p>
<p>The <code>reversals()</code> utility identifies reversal points, whereas <code>reversmean()</code> produces a dose-averaging estimate whose starting cut-point is determined by a reversal. User can choose whether to use all doses from that cut-point onwards, or only the reversals as in the older approaches. A few additional options make the estimate even more flexible.
</p>
<p>More broadly, dose-averaging despite some advantages is not very robust, and also <strong>lacks an interval estimate with reliable coverage.</strong> Therefore, <code>reversmean()</code> provides neither a confidence interval nor a standard error.
</p>
<p>For UDD target estimation we recommend using centered isotonic regression, available via <code><a href="#topic+udest">udest</a></code>, an up-and-down adapted wrapper to <code>cir::quickInverse()</code>. See Oron et al. 2022 (both article and supplement) for further information, as well as the <code>cir</code> package vignette.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>For <code>reversals()</code>, the indices of reversal points. For <code>reversmean()</code>, if <code>full=FALSE</code> returns the point estimate and otherwise returns a data frame with the estimate as well, as the index of the cutoff point used to start the averaging.

# Does it reproduce the article estimate?
dixonmood(doses, responses)

# Not at all! Let us overlay this one in red
abline(h = dixonmood(doses, responses), col=2)

# We have found that many articles claiming to use Dixon-Mood (or Dixon-Massey) actually
# Do something else. For example, in this article they report that 
#   "it is necessary to reject sequences with three to six identical results".
# Nothing like this appears in the original Dixon-Mood article, where the estimation method
#   involves identifying the less-common response (either 0 or 1), and using only x values
#   associated with these responses; obviating the need to exclude specific sequences.
#
# More generally, these historical estimates have long passed their expiry dates. 
#   Their foundation is not nearly as solid as, e.g., linear regression, 
#      and it's time to stop using them.

# That said, our package does offer two more types of dose-averaging estimates.
# Both are able to take advantage of the "n+1" dose-allocation, which is determined by
#    the last dose and response:
n = length(doses)
dosePlus1 = doses[n] + ifelse(responses[n]==0, 1, -1)
reversmean(c(doses, dosePlus1), responses)
# Interestingly, in this particular case the answer is very similar to the Dixon-Mood estimate.

# The `reversmean()` default averages all doses from the 3rd reversal point onwards.
# By the way, at what point did the third reversal happen? 
#     It'll be the 3rd number in this vector:
reversals(responses)

# Far more commonly in literature, particularly in sensory studies, 
#   one encounters the 1960s-era approach (led by Wetherill) of taking *only doses  
#   at reversal points, usually starting from the first one. `reversmean()` can do that too:
wetherill = reversmean(c(doses, dosePlus1), responses, all = FALSE, rstart = 1)
wetherill
# This one gives an even lower result than the previous ones.
abline(h = wetherill, col = 3)

# There's another approach to dose-averaging, although it is not in use anywhere that we know of.
# It does not require the y values at all. The underlying assumption is that the dose 
#   sequence has done enough meandering around the true balance point, to provide information
#   about where (approximately) the starting-dose effect is neutralized.
adaptmean(c(doses, dosePlus1))
# Again a bit curiously, this relatively recent approach gives a result similar to what
#   the authors reported (but not similar to the original Dixon-Mood).
# This is not too surprising, since here `adaptmean()` excludes the first one-third of doses,
#   which is approximately what happened if indeed the authors excluded all those long dose-increase
#   sequences at the start.

# All this shows how dicey dose-averaging, at face value a simple and effective method, can become.
# The sample size here is rather large for up-and-down studies, and yet because of the unlucky
#    choice of starting point (which in many studies, due to safety concerns cannot be evaded)
#    there is really no good option of which observations to exclude.

# This is one reason why we strongly recommend using Centered Isotonic Regression as default:
defest = udest(doses, responses, target = 0.5)
abline(h = defest$point, col = 'purple')
# For this dataset, it is the highest of all the estimates.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>CIR and related methods are available in the <code>cir</code> package. The <code>udest()</code> function in the present package provides a convenient wrapper for <code>cir::quickInverse()</code>, with arguments already set to the appropriate values for estimating the target dose after an up-and-down experiment. The function also returns a confidence interval as default.
</p>
<p><strong>WARNING!</strong> You should not estimate target doses too far removed from the design's actual balance point (definitely no further than 0.1, e.g., estimating the 33rd percentile for a design whose balance point is the median). As Flournoy and Oron (2020) explain, observed response rates are biased away from the balance point. Even though <code>udest()</code> performs the rudimentary bias correction described in that article, practically speaking this correction's role is mostly to expand the confidence intervals in response to the bias. It cannot guarantee to provide reliable off-balance-point estimates.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A one-row data frame with 4 variables: <code>target</code>, <code>point</code> (the point estimate), <code style="white-space: pre;">&#8288;lowerXYconf, upperXYconf&#8288;</code> (the confidence bounds, with <code>XY</code> standing for the percents, default <code>90</code>).

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This simple and handy visualization approach was presented already by Dixon and Mood (1948).
</p>

<ul>
<li><p> It conveys directly the meaning of <em>&quot;up-and-down&quot;</em>, because the administered dose/stimulus strength is on the y-axis, whereas observation order is on the x-axis.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Filled symbols stand for positive responses and open symbols for negative.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The design's transition rules can be usually inferred directly from the plot.
</p>
</li></ul>

<p><code>udplot()</code> is a convenience wrapper to <code>cir::plot.DRtrace</code>. This is a base-R plot, so you can use additional options, including preceding the plot command with <code><a href="graphics.html#topic+par">par</a></code> statements, or following up with <code><a href="graphics.html#topic+legend">legend</a></code>. When wishing to save to a file, I recommend utilities such as <code>png()</code> or <code>pdf()</code>.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Returns invisibly after plotting. If you would like to save the plot to a file, embed the plotting code in a standard R graphics export code sequence, (e.g., <code>pdf(...)</code> before the plotting function, and <code>dev.off()</code> after it).

<td>
<p>string, name of variable to plug in for reporting the error back</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="validUDinput_+3A_toolarge">toolarge</code></td>
<td>
<p>(<code>checkNatural()</code> only) what number would be considered too large to be realistic?</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="validUDinput_+3A_x">x</code></td>
<td>
<p>(<code>checkDose()</code> only) input object to be verified as valid dose values</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="validUDinput_+3A_maxfrac">maxfrac</code></td>

<p>(<code>checkResponse()</code> only) input object to be verified as valid response values ('TRUE/FALSE or 0/1)</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>If a validation issue is found, these functions stop with a relevant error message. If no issue is found, they run through without returning a value.
